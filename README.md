# Good First Issues!

Do you have a project or community that might offer some "Good First Issues"

and any issue labeled with "Good First Issue" will show up automatically in the list.
That's it!

This respository uses the [rseng/good-first-issues](https://github.com/rseng/good-first-issues)
action to generate and update issues. We have automation in [.github/workflows/main.yaml](.github/workflows/main.yaml)
to automate adding repos with good first issues:

```bash
$ python .github/scripts/add-repos.py
```

Thanks for stopping by!
