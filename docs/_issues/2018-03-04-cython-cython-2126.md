Investigating the C++ code generated from

```
# cython: np_pythran=True

from __future__ import absolute_import

import numpy as np
cimport numpy as np
cimport cython

def roll(np.int8_t[::1] state, Py_ssize_t idx):
    return np.roll(state, -idx, axis=0)
```

shows that Pythran is not used to implement ``np.roll``, while there's support for that in Pythran.
