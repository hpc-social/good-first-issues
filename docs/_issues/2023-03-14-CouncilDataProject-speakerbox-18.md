### Feature Description

<!-- A clear and concise description of the feature you're requesting. -->

Support a more direct directory structure of speakers instead of "conversations". i.e.:

```
data/
├── bob/
|   ├── 0.wav
|   ├── 1.wav
|   ├── 2.wav
|   ├── 3.wav
|   ├── 4.wav
├── sally/
|   ├── 5.wav
|   ├── 6.wav
|   ├── 7.wav
|   ├── 8.wav
|   ├── 9.wav
└── eva/
    ├── 10.wav
    ├── 11.wav
    ├── 12.wav
    ├── 13.wav
    ├── 14.wav
```

Where all the audio for each speaker is provided as a directory. This would involve creating new functions for preparing the dataset -- with no guarantee that the "conversation id" holdout condition is met.
