Folks may want this rather than having to generate the entire reservoir parameters from `create_grand_parameters.py`.

The task would be to read in result data from a completed simulation, calculate the monthly average flow and demand at reservoir locations, and save to parquet format, ideally with appropriate metadata regarding the timeframe and inputs used in the simulation.
