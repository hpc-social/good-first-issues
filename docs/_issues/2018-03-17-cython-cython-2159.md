title: "Coercing a sliced C array to Python should create a list"

Cython already copies a C array into a Python list automatically on object coercion. It should do the same for sliced C arrays, e.g.
```
def test():
    cdef int i
    cdef int a[100]
    for i in range(100):
        a[i] = i**2
    return a[:20]  # rejected by type analysis
```
Currently results in
`Cannot convert 'int *' to Python object`.
