Hello, 
    Considering your amazing efficiency on pandas, numpy, and more, it would seem to make sense for your module to work with even bigger data, such as Audio (for example .mp3 and .wav). This is something that would help a lot considering the nature audio (ie. where one of the lowest and most common sampling rates is still 44,100 samples/sec). For a use case, I would consider vaex.open('HugeData.mp3')
