Currently our non-notebook examples are manually included in the examples webpage via custom `.rst` files in `tutorial/source/`.  As the number of examples increases, it would be better to follow [NumPyro's approach](http://pyro.ai/numpyro/examples/) and generate HTML pages automatically with [`sphinx_gallery`](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html).  This would make examples easier to find and read, improve the design of the tutorial page, and declutter our tutorial folder on GitHub.  Many of the examples also contain extensive docstrings and comments that `sphinx_gallery` could automatically render in HTML.

More ambitiously, we might even aim to use `sphinx_gallery` to include tutorials in ReadTheDocs, simplifying our release process and removing the lag between new tutorials being added on GitHub and becoming visible on the examples web page.
