I'm currently taking a Data Science class at Cal Poly and I've noticed that I have many notebooks and terminals open. I thought it would be helpful to have a button that closes everything at once and pops a dialogue up to make sure of the delete, rather than clicking on every single button to shutdown the notebooks. Even though people can call, $('.btn.btn-warning.btn-xs').click(), to close all notebooks, I think it would be more intuitive to just have a button.
