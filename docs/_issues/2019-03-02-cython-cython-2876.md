When creating a Python class, if I put docstrings under the class name or under `__init__`, these would show up, respectively, under `class.__doc__` and `class.__init__.__doc__`, e.g.:

```python
class cl:
	"""ds1"""
    def __init__(self, a=1):
        """ds2"""
        self.a = a
```
```python
cl.__doc__ == "ds1"
cl.__init__.__doc__ == "ds2"
```
Usually, documentation is picked by other tools from the `__init__` part, so that's where it's usually put, and in such case `class.__doc__` will be empty (Python `None`).

But with Cython classes having embedded signatures, if I put a docstring under `__init__`, it will still generate a non-empty `class.__doc__`, which will contain the function arguments but not the rest, e.g.
```python
cimport cython
@cython.embedsignature(True)
cdef class cl:
	cdef int a
	def __init__(self, a = 1):
		"""ds"""
		self.a = a
```
```
cl.__doc__ == "cl(a=1)"
cl.__init__.__doc__ == "ds"
```
(And if I don't put it, it wouldn't document the arguments)

Would be nice if documentation would work the same as in regular Python (i.e. don't create `class.__doc__` if the docstring is under `__init__`), as it makes it easier for the documentation to work with other tools. For example, sphinx will by default look for `__doc__` first, so in this case it ends up (by default) showing only the function call documentation and not the user docstring.
