See screenshot:

Though the example uses Haiku, Haiku is just calling through to `lax.conv_transpose`.

The difference is in reversing the spatial axes of the kernel.

We can do at least two things to make this less surprising and more easily fixable:
1. document the difference, and
2. add an argument to `lax.conv_transpose` to instead use the TF convention.
