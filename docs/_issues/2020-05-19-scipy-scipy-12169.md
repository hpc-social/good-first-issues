Dear Scipy Team,

I would like to report a potential issue with the implementation of Dice Coefficient in Scipy.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) (see section "Difference from Jaccard") and papers such as [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4533825/) (see Equations (8) and (9)), there is a direct relationship between the Dice Coefficient and the Jaccard Index. 

However, when I calculated the Dice Coefficient using the Scipy package and compared with the results obtained by using this direct relationship with the Jaccard Index, the results doesn't match. I have also calculated Dice using the metrics from the Confusion Matrix (eg. TP, FP etc.), and the results doesn't match with the Scipy package.

I have included an example showing this here: https://github.com/leockl/Dice-Coefficient/blob/master/Dice.ipynb

Could someone have a look at this. Many thanks.
