If we look in the others routines (say other_energy https://github.com/MESAHub/mesa/blob/main/star/other/other_energy.f90) we see that some of the module use statements are in the module level, not the function level: https://github.com/MESAHub/mesa/blob/a7e70eccb27fefecf8875a8d5fbbdb824acc1938/star/other/other_energy.f90#L34

To make copy and paste easier we should just move all the module use's into the functions so they become self contained.
