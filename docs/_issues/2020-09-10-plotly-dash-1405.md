Dash modules installed : 

```dash                      1.13.4
dash-bootstrap-components 0.10.5
dash-core-components      1.10.1
dash-html-components      1.0.3
dash-renderer             1.5.1
dash-table                4.8.1
```
I have a Dash app displayed as an iframe inside a Flask app. All components work fine, but not the Interval one, which is never updated.

If I run my Dash app as a standalone app, it works.

Would there be a workaround ?
