The documentation is currently lacking, to say the least. Here is what a minimal working documentation looks like:

- [ ] HOW TO
    - [x] Metropolis-within-Gibbs
    - [ ] Sample loop
    - [x] Multiple chains 
    - [x] Adaptation
    - [ ] Distribute gradient computation 
    - [x] PyMC
    - [x] Aesara
    - [x] Numpyro
    - [x] TFP
- [ ] TUTORIAL
    - [ ] Building a HMC sampler (internal modularity)
    - [ ] Stop/Restart the inference
- [x] A catalogue of inference methods, their API, the notebooks where they are showcased
- [ ] #235 
- [ ] EXPLAIN
  - [ ] Kernel pattern & composition 
  - [ ] Modularity 
  - [ ] 3 layers of abstraction
  - [ ] Sample then update parameters
  - [ ] Vectorizing
- [ ] #25
