[This feels like this issue should already be open]

Using @dpshelio's example he made for this diffrot PR:

Creating examples is more than just copy and pasting code, you need to have some understanding of that the code is doing.

It is important to explain the reason behind the example, any parts of the code that are confusing for first time readers and explaining the outcome from each code snippet.
