Hi,

I was training a LDASeqModel on ~40k documents through 20 years (20 time slices in my case) and after 2 days of computation, still didn't finish.

I realized that only LDAModel is used in this class. Shouldn't be better to use LDAMulticore since it can also handle the case of single core ?

Thanks
