### What is the expected enhancement?
Graph operations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_operations) produce new graphs from initial ones. Right now retworkx can `compose`, take the `union` of two graphs or return the `complement` of a graph. We can expand this list similar to  NetworkX functionality https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/operators.html.
