## Bug Description
When `hasMaterialProperty` is used in the `InputParameters` in a material, the ordering of the input file on whether the material will be found or not. Strangely, `getDefaultMaterialProperty` from `DerivativeMaterialInterface` does not have a problem with the ordering, I think because it uses `haveMaterialProperty` instead of `hasMaterialProperty`. `getDefaultMaterialProperty` seems like a useful function and should maybe be in `MaterialPropertyInterface` so it can be more readily used (e.g. #13876). But really, `hasMaterialProperty` shouldn't be dependent on input file ordering. 

## Steps to Reproduce
See associated PR with test code that reproduces this issue.

## Impact
This prevents robust checking for material properties.
