**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I would like to have a button (similar to *house button*) that centers the model on screen and fills the screen (zooms to fill up the viewport). The *house button* also rotates - without that.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A button that does the same as the *house button*, without the rotation. Similar functionality is for example available in AutoCAD, "Zoom, all".

When adding, please update the wiki page about *Camera control* as well.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Perhaps only a change of the *house button* could suffice?

**Additional context**
This function should be available to all visual unit tests, in order to center the model every time a view direction is changed.
