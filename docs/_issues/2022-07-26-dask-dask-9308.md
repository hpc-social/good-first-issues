We have some methods that operate on Dask DataFrame Index (sometimes this is slightly different from how they operate on DataFrame/Series, eg: #9290). It'll be nice to document these. 

Maybe we can have a new section `Index` after `Series` here: https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/dataframe-api.html, which will include the methods defined in https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/6bad4c200bea46c76023c52fdf720200881eadda/dask/dataframe/core.py#L4096
