Good evening, I am currently struggling with compiling SU2 from source code. After I have built the program I try to compile it using ninja.exe, but during the process I get the following error:

```
[443/454] Linking target SU2_DEF/src/SU2_DEF.exe
FAILED: SU2_DEF/src/SU2_DEF.exe

ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.
```

I do not understand what causes the problem since MPI should have been correctly installed and the msmpi.lib file is present in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\MPI\Lib\x64.
I imagine this is a trivial problem due to my inexperience but I am not able to understand how to fix it.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
