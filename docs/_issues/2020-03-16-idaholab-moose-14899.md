## Reason
<!--Why do you need this feature or what is the enhancement?-->
In #14871 a new function (`registerSystemAttributeName`) was added to the InputParameters object to associate an object with the system the object should be executed with, e.g., UserObjects or Samplers. The `registerBase` function should be renamed to something more explicit.

## Design
<!--A concise description (design) of what you want to happen.--->
Deprecate `registerBase` and replace it with `registerSyntaxName` or something else?

## Impact
<!--Will the enhancement change existing public APIs, internal APIs, or add something new?-->
Minimal, users will get a deprecated message, but this fix will be a simple name change.
