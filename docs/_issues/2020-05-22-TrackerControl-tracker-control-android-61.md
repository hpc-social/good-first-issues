Since the app already supports a child socks proxy if it also supported a parent then potentially other apps that "require" a local vpn could chain themselves through the socks proxy.  This might eliminate the need for local support of the encrypted dns and ad blocking while allowing someone to use this app in coordination with a REAL vpn.

This would of course require the other apps to make a change to support the proxy but it has potential.
