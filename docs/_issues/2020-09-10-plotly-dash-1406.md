In recent versions (can't say from exactly when), there seems to be an off-by-one error in dcc.DatePickerRange. I set `max_date_allowed = datetime.today().date()`, but in the calendar, yesterday is the maximum date allowed. I see it in my apps, and it is also present in the first example on the [DatePickerRange documentation page](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/datepickerrange).

Example:
```
html.Div(
        dcc.DatePickerRange(
            id="date_range",
            start_date_placeholder_text="Start Period",
            end_date_placeholder_text="End Period",
            max_date_allowed=datetime.today().date(),
            display_format="YYYY-MM-DD",
            first_day_of_week=1,
            clearable=True,
            minimum_nights=0,
            persistence=True,
        ),
    )
```
I've also tried connecting callbacks to State("date_range", "max_date_allowed"), and there the received max date is today's date, so it only appears in the frontend.
