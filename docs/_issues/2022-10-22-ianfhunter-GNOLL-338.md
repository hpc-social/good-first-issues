## What is a Macro?

It will be more likely for players to use GNOLL if their favourite game/system is easy to use. One part of this is having some built-in support for various systems via the Macro functionality.

Macros allow a user to retrieve a previously defined dice. Meaning they do not have to repeat lengthy dice definitions in their GNOLL statements. 

This is a general ticket for adding Macros of different types and sources.

## What Macros to add?
Here are some sources of inspiration for non standard dice we may like to add built-ins for:
 - https://www.dicecollector.com/THE_DICE_THEME_GAMES.html 
 - https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/37741/dice-dicey-love-affair

You can also check for the "Macro Request" label in our github issues tab.

## Creating Macros

The best place to learn how to create a macro is to either read our [Documentation](https://www.ianhunter.ie/GNOLL/notation/custom_macros.html) or to look in the `builtins` folder at previous work.
