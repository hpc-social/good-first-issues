**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Would be nice to have simpler access to the csvy writer for general model creation.  Currently it is a part of the custom abundance widget, but the tool is generally useful.

Current location: https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/blob/e1181bd5ad3a382ed86ab4774ca77bcf964f0a94/tardis/visualization/widgets/custom_abundance.py#L1384

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Move this over to the io module to make access easier.
