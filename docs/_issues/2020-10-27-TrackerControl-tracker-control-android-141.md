Right now, NetGuard is using my only VPN spot; I'd be perfect if tracker-control could HOST a SOCKS5 proxy (like the Orbot app does), so that it could be used in conjuction with NetGuard.
With the right implementation we might even be able to chain the SOCKS5 proxies, and use NetGuard + Tracker-Control + Orbot :D
