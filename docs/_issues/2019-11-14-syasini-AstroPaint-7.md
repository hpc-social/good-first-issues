Add transformation method for converting different mass definitions to each other, in particular, M_200m -> M_200c. 

The current version only takes in M_200c, but for example, WebSky only provides M_200m. A transformation function is needed (in the `lib.transform` module) to convert the mass. 

comment for further clarification on details.
