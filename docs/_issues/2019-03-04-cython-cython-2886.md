When trying to use a `.pxd` from an external module and making sure it can be found on `sys.path`, Cythonize/Cython compilation will still fail to pick it up if that module only has  `__init__.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` but no `__init__.py` (which it obviously couldn't have, given the `__init__` part is already that C extension).

As soon as I do `touch __init__.py` in that folder it's all picked up fine, but of course that's not really a meaningful thing to do and renders the module broken, which I think I shouldn't have to do just so I can import `.pxd` files from it, should I?

So this looks a bit like a Cython bug to me, tested with Cython 0.29.6
