Hi everyone,

the optimization [user guide](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/tutorial/optimize.html) currently does not contain any form of easily accessible comparison of the different solver capabilties.

I think this would be helpful for many users as the typical questions for someone looking to solve an optimization problem are (for example been requested in #16191):
* How do I formulate my problem with this package?
* Which solver is probably a good fit for me?

As a first start of discussion, I created a google doc table to compare the local and global solvers:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PNpOcy99qfn-ip168vL4Qskc3bpybJP7e2vpuhrQKN4/edit#gid=0

Let me know if you think that an important category is missing.
