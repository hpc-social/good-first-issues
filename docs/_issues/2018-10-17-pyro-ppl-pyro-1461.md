## Goal

Add creative examples of Pyro code developed by users out in the real world to our catalog of examples and tutorials. This is great for the community as a whole and helps the Pyro dev team focus on features that are useful to you and the broader community.

## Context

The Pyro dev team met a bunch of Pyro users at [ProbProg 2018](https://probprog.cc/) and heard about a variety of interesting applications of Pyro.

## What is being asked

We realize that writing a clean piece of code that can be read by and is useful to a wide audience is difficult. We are also aware that some code/data cannot easily be made public. Wherever possible we are eager to help you overcome some of these potential barriers by
- helping you clean up and comment your contributed code (and possibly add CUDA support)
- help you find alternative datasets when needed
- help you extract a smaller example of Pyro usage from a larger context

## Who?

Anyone reading this!
