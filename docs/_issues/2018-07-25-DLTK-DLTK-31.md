In augmentation, elastic_transform, it only applies a random transform on one input image array. I would think to be used for training, the image and mask pair should be transform in the same way. However, this single-input-image, single-output-image method makes it very inconvenient. Could we deform a list of images (np.arrays) using the same transformation in this method ? Thanks!
