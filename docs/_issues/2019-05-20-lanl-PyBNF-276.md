Using the `normalization` key to map a normalization type to an exp file creates a confusing situation when there is also a prop file with the same suffix. 

Looks like what currently happens is if you use the syntax `normalization = init : data.exp`, all columns of simulation suffix `data` get normalized for all uses. So if you also had a data.prop for something not even appearing in data.exp, it would get normalized.
