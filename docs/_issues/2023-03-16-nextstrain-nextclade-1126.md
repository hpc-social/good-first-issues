Virus properties only supports labeling of substitutions. There are mutations of interest, such as antiviral resistance, Ngene, which are deletions. 

My usecase for virus properties might be outside the scope of what was envisioned. Essentially I have a set of genetic mutations (snps, indels) that are linked to some phenotype (antiviral resistance, Ngene mutations affecting RAT tests) that I am interested in. I would like to use Nextclade to identify these mutations.

Thanks!
