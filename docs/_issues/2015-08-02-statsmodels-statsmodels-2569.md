see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31768464/confidence-interval-for-t-test-difference-between-means-in-python

to make the interface more convenient in weightstats CompareMeans, we could add `from_data` and `summary` methods.

summary could print a summary table (1 row) similar to `LikelihoodResults.t_test` and `Contrast`

Note: weightstats CompareMeans was written before Contrast results gained the summary and other enhancements, and we never checked for adding similar improvements.
