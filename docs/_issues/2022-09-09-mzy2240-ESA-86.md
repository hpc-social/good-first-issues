1. Reduce the number of conditions by using formatted string

e.g. 

```python
if target == 'MW':
    flow = gen.loc[i, 'GenMW']
```
can be optimized into

```python
flow = gen.loc[i, f"Gen{target}"]
```

2. When computing the EFM, compute the line flow and the loss induced EFM together

3. Use loc instead of column + index to access cells for better readiness and performance
