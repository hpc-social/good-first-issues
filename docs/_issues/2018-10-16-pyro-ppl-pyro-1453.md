Users at PROBPROG 2018 requested more-specific error messages when models are invalid.

Specific improvements include:
- [x] #1509 Print sample site information when `Distribution` inputs are invalid. Currently it requires a debugger to see what line of the model is affected.
- [x] #1534 On error print shapes of sites in the trace: value shape for params, and value,dist,log_prob shapes for sample sites.
- [ ] On error, print contextual information: the current `cond_indep_stack`, the portion of stack trace under `svi.step()`, whether the model or guide is being executed, `_DIM_ALLOCATOR` sate, tracing state, etc. This could be accomplished via a `try: except: raise` block to add information to a caught error.
- others?
