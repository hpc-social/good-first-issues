## Description
https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3273 made the buffer time configurable using notebook config.  Currently it is hardcoded in [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/7204b461515890d86cba5a3b51832708ae265e8a/packages/docregistry/src/context.ts#L626).   This value should be configurable using settings.
