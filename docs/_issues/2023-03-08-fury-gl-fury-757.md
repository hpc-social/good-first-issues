Currently the SelectionManager works as expected for selecting triangle representations of surfaces.

However when we have surfaces represented with triangle strips we need to be more careful and find the correct triangle indices from the strips.

To see the issue you can start by modifying the ``viz_selection.py`` tutorial and add actors that use strips such as streamtube and then try to select those and start debugging the issue.
