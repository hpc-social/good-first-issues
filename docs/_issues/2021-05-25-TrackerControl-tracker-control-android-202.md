I noticed that TC is using a enormous amount of data, whether in wifi or cellular. It reaches around 200-300 MB of daily data, and I've got a total of 1.2 GB for the last 4 days.

Is it some sort of "virtual data usage", i.e. data wrongly attributed to TC whereas it was actually established by another app, or data wrongly counted but actually blocked by TC thus not visible out of the smartphone ?
