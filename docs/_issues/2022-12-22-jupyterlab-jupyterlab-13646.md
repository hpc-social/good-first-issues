### Problem

For someone new to extension development, it can be difficult to know where each area is located. For example `header` which is hidden by default.

### Proposed Solution

There is already a section in the docs that list all the areas: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_points.html#jupyter-front-end-shell

We could extend the section with a screenshot that highlights and annotate them visually:

But including the `header` area as well, and maybe another screenshot for the simple mode.
