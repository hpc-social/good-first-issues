Recent discussions on Discourse suggest that not all users know about `apropos` (or equivalently, using `?"..."` for text search). The startup message currently mentions

```
Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
```

I suggest that text search is added to this, but I am still looking for a compact way of phrasing it.
