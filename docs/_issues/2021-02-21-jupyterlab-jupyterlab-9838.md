I'm trying to drag-and-drop both files and folders from the Windows File Explorer to the JupyterLab (v2.2.8) file browser pane. It works fine for files, but doesn't for folders. See screenshot below. The response from the UI suggests that it should work - it just doesn't do anything. I'm trying from Chrome on Windows 10. JupyterLab is being hosted by JupyterHub 1.0 running on Linux.
