Consider the following case
```
cdef class Foo(object):
    def __bool__(self):
        return True
    def __nonzero__(self):
        return self.__bool__()
```

This causes a `RecursionError` when calling `bool(Foo())`

I know the work around is specifying only `__bool__` but it's still a bug IMHO
