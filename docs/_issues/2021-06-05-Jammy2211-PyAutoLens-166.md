The following paper details a mass profile that is well suited to strong lensing, called the Dekel-Zhao profile:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08395

The deflection angle calculation for a spherical model is given by equation (38):

The expression looks pretty complicated, but actually boils down to a fairly straight forward calculation using various scipy / expansions.

It would be good to implement this mass profile in the module `autogalaxy.profiles.mass_profiles.dark_mass_profiles`:

https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/blob/master/autogalaxy/profiles/mass_profiles/dark_mass_profiles.py

A template for the profile is as follows:

```
class SphDekel(mp.MassProfile, DarkProfile):
    def __init__(
        self,
        centre: Tuple[float, float] = (0.0, 0.0),
        kappa_0: float = 0.05,
        another_parameter: float = 1.0,
    ):
        """
        The spherical Dekel profile, used to fit the dark matter halo of the lens.

        Parameters
        ----------
        centre

        kappa_0
            The overall normalization of the dark matter halo for the Dekel profile.
        """

        super().__init__(
            centre=centre,
            elliptical_comps=(0.0, 0.0),
        )
     
        self.kappa_0 = kappa_0
