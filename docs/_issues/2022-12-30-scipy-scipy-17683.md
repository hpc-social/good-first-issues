I noticed a few functions in `scipy.stats.mstats` that have no tests:
- [ ] [`median_cihs`](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mstats.median_cihs.html)
- [ ] [`sen_seasonal_slopes`](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mstats.sen_seasonal_slopes.html)
- [ ] [`trimmed_var`](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mstats.trimmed_var.html)
- [ ] [`trimmed_std`](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mstats.trimmed_std.html)

I added the 'good first issue' tag, because the *code* required to add tests is simple. Tests for all the functions do not have to be added in a single pull request.  I suspect `trimmed_var` and `trimmed_std` would be the easiest ones to add tests for, and a single pull request that covers both of them should be easy.  The other two will probably require some understanding of what the functions compute, so those could be considered "good first issue for someone with knowledge of the statistics involved".
