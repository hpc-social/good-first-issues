Some ideas:

- [x] example converting existing dataframe with x/y columns
- [ ] make interactive plot with folium or ipyleaflet
- [ ] combined plot of raster and vector data
- [ ] combine with rasterio (eg extracting values from raster based on Point series)
- [x] examples with geoplot
- [ ] sjoin example
- [ ] example using the spatial index (`.sindex`) explicitly
