In a terminal window, when I type in `?foo` it prints out the entire documentation (ending with complicated examples often) and I often have to scroll all the way to get the function signature. In contrast, typing in `?foo` in the R REPL launches documentation as a "window" starting at the top where one and scroll up and down and press `q` to exit. 

Is it possible to do something like this in the `?` mode of the REPL?
