Problem: Request for a Catboost Tutorial for Regression problems
catboost version: Any version
Operating System: WIndows
CPU: i7
# GPU: None

Hi Yandex, I am currently learning how to use Catboost for ML projects. Would love to have a tutorial on Regression problems using real data set consists of mixture of categorical and numerical features.

Please do not use those generic datasets like Boston Housing et al. You can select one proper dataset from Kaggle et al as an example. 

The tutorial must geared for first time users hence comments and guidance in Jupyter Notebook will be helpful.

Thanks much.
