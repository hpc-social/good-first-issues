We currently print a warning as shown below when a user sets both a widget default value in the function defining the widget as well as a widget value via the widget's key in `st.session_state`

While we certainly want to do this by default since doing both is not recommended, we should provide a config option allowing users to disable the warning in case there's a good reason a user might want to do this.
