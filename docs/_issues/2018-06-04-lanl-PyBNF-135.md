DREAM has different final distributions than Parallel Tempering and MCMC.  PT and MCMC match the result from Harmon et al 2017, but that's unsurprising given that the paper used an earlier version of the same code.

Good evaluation to confirm who's right would be to try to reproduce the distributions in Kozer 2013.
