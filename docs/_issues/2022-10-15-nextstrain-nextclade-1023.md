Preparing the download of a nextclade.zip can take a while but after clicking on the download symbol, there is no indication that the preparation of the download has been initiated.

One UI suggestion: once the download button has been clicked, you could animate the download symbol to go from the top to the bottom. It would also be nice to disable the button to prevent further clicks and change the `cursor` from a `pointer` to something else.
