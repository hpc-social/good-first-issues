### What is the expected enhancement?


The directed graph class `PyDiGraph` has a method `substitute_node_with_subgraph()` to replace a node in the graph with an input graph. However, the undirected graph class `PyGraph` doesn't have this method. It would be good if we filled this feature gap and add this method to the `PyGraph` class too.
