#### Description:

We need some easy to follow instructions on how to use the core Stan inside a user-written C++ program. See https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/issues/3085 for example.

The instruction can simply guide through the task of compiling one of the models and running MCMC with the services. The biggest challenges are typically all the dependencies that we need to include in the C++ compiler calls.

#### Current Version:
v2.28.1
