Our current bootstrapping implementation is non-parametric bootstrapping (the normal kind), which works under the assumption that (x,y) pairs are independently drawn from a distribution. 

A colleague suggested adding an option for the "wild bootstrap", which assumes the independent variable is at fixed values, and only the dependent variable is drawn from a distribution.
