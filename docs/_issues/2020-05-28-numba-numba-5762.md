## Feature request

Currently Numba supplies [`set_memory_manager`]( http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda/external-memory.html#numba.cuda.set_memory_manager ), which allows the user to swap in an external memory manage for Numba. It would be useful to have a `get_memory_manager` to access the underlying memory manager.
