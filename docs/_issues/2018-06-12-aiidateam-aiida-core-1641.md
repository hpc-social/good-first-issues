I am new to AiiDA and installed version v0.12.0 and wanted to find out how I can use the `copy_from_remote_to_remote method` to copy a file from one remote computer to another. 

I don't understand how exactly I can use it and how the parameters need to be defined. 

From [this here](https://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/aiida/transport.html#copy_from_remote_to_remote) I know that the last two parameters remote source and destination need to be paths, but how exactly is transportsource and transportdestination defined? 

It would be very helpful if there is a code example or other tutorial available and I'm sorry if it is something obvious but I struggle with understanding how to use it. 

Thanks for helping!
