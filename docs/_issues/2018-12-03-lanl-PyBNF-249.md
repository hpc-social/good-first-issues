title: "SBML timeout not supported if PyBNF installed through PyPI"

For enforcing the `wall_time_sim` for SBML models, we use a hack where the simulation is actually run in the separate script sbml-runner.py . If installing through PyPI, sbml-runner.py is not installed, so the `wall_time_sim` option fails

Additionally, the current error message generated for this case is not informative.
