I'm not sure why `lsmagic` needs to return a JSON data structure by default - but the end result is that in JupyterLab, it becomes kind of useless... In Classic calling `%lsmagic` produces (clipped for simplicity):

while in Lab, this is the output:

Lab defaults to showing JSON reprs when available, which typically makes sense, so while this is a change in behavior re. Classic, I'm inclined to think it's a good step forward.

Users can get the text via

but that's  a pretty awkward experience.  Do we really need `lsmagic` to produce JSON by default? It seems to me that generating plain text would be fine most of the time, perhaps with a `--json/-j` option for JSON output when desired?
