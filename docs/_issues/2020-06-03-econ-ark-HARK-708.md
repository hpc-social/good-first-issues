- Setup GitHub Actions to build whenever a tag(release) is associated to a commit.
- (optional?) add the middle step of pushing it to TestPyPI server.
- upload it to PyPI using https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish.
- conda forge is already automated through fetching PyPI release, just a PR needs to be a merged at https://github.com/conda-forge/econ-ark-feedstock
