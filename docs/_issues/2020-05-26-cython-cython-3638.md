The latest copy of the CPython grammar tests in [test_grammar.py](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/tests/run/test_grammar.py) has several `@skip`s and `FIXME`s. Some of them seem easy to fix, e.g. some parser bugs or missing warnings that would be helpful, others are entire features. We should fix the easy ones and make sure there are tickets for the rest.
