PR #6447 adds a public API to get the maximum number of registers per thread (`numba.cuda.Dispatcher.get_regs_per_thread()`). There are other attributes that might be nice to provide - shared memory per block, local memory per thread, const memory usage, maximum block size.

These are all available in the `FuncAttr` named tuple: https://github.com/numba/numba/blob/master/numba/cuda/cudadrv/driver.py#L2023, set by `_read_func_attr_all`: https://github.com/numba/numba/blob/master/numba/cuda/cudadrv/driver.py#L2067

Cross ref: adding these would provide some of the info in the ptxas output requested in #3482.
