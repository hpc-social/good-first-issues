In the `JSOCClient` docstring, [it says that you must wait for your request status to be 0 before downloading the requested files.](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/blob/243d010f2af588fa75019317a07f4bad3bf6b61b/sunpy/net/jsoc/jsoc.py#L220) I don't think this is accurate. I've downloaded all requested files when the status of my request was 2 (though I'm not sure what this status code actually indicates). 

[Additionally, the `wait` method does not exist on whatever is returned from `JSOCClient.get_request()`](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/blob/243d010f2af588fa75019317a07f4bad3bf6b61b/sunpy/net/jsoc/jsoc.py#L237).

This example code is all marked as `DOCTEST: SKIP` (for good and obvious reasons) so I don't know when the last time this was actually tested.
