### Problem

<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of what problem this feature will solve. For example:

* I'm always frustrated when [...] because [...]

It would be nice if it was possible to write out paths in the "File browser" and not only be able to navigate the directory tree by clicking.

### Proposed Solution

<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of a way to accomplish what you want. For example:

* Add an option so that when [...]  [...] will happen
 -->

Allow to edit the path. Of course clicking should still be possible - so it would need something similar to what file managers (dophin, file explorer on windows) do.

### Additional context

As a workaround one can probably paste the path to the url but that's less intuitive.
