A tricky part about Dash is how callbacks need to be registered before the app starts (https://community.plot.ly/t/dynamic-controls-and-dynamic-output-components/5519).

Some users register them later:
- Perhaps they are wrapping up callbacks in their own component classes and the callbacks are only registered when the class is instantiated
- Or perhaps they register these callbacks inside _another_ callback, see https://community.plot.ly/t/dynamcially-create-layout-elements-and-callbacks-and-then-add-new-ones/19008

Seems like we should "freeze" callback instantiation after app start and raise a helpful exception pointing them to some documentation about why they can't register callbacks after the server has started.
