Following the discussion in https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/44168#discussion_r805863793 (and https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/MKL.jl/issues/106) I suggest to copy https://carstenbauer.github.io/ThreadPinning.jl/dev/explanations/blas/ into somewhere in the Julia manual if @carstenbauer is OK with it.
