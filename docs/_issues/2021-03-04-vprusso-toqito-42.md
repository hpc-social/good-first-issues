Implement a function that calculates the min-relative entropy for quantum channels. 

The functionality for this should be created in `channel_props/min_relative_entropy.py` with corresponding unit tests found in `tests/test_channel_props/test_min_relative_entropy.py`. Be sure to also update the docs in `/docs/channels.rst` under "Properties of Quantum Channels" with `toqito.channel_props.min_relative_entropy.py`.
