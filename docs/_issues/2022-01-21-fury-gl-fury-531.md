This will allow the cylinder to have the same behavior when picking vertices or edges as with other primitives.

However, we should also keep repeat_sources as a secondary option just in case we need to use some of the other VTK filters.

See an example of box actor (using repeat_primitives) here https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/blob/master/fury/actor.py#L1696
