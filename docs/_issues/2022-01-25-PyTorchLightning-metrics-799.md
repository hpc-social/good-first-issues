## ðŸš€ Feature

just found this package and seems we have not yet all Image metrics :] 
some inspiration came from https://github.com/andrewekhalel/sewar but we aim on own implementation with `torch`

### Alternatives

- ~Mean Squared Error (MSE)~
- ~Root Mean Sqaured Error (RMSE)~
- ~Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)~
- ~Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)~
- ~Universal Quality Image Index (UQI)~
- ~Multi-scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM)~
- ~Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de SynthÃ¨se (ERGAS)~
- [ ] Spatial Correlation Coefficient (SCC) -> #800
- [x] Relative Average Spectral Error (RASE) -> #816
- ~Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM)~
- ~Spectral Distortion Index (D_lambda)~
- [ ] Spatial Distortion Index (D_S)
- [ ] Quality with No Reference (QNR) 
- [ ] Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) -> @yashika-git
- [ ] Block Sensitive - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR-B) -> #1421 

### Additional context

any of these metrics would be a separate PR/addition :]
