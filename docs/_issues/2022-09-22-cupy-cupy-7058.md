### Description

Thanks to Cupy, I'm able to migrate my project from CPU to GPU. 

However, I rely on `scipy.sparse.diag_block` operation, which is not available in Cupy. I have to do this on CPU with scipy and transfer the data to GPU. We have `linalg.block_diag` but that only takes dense matrix. Is there any plan to implement it for sparse matrix as well? If not, is there a way around or I have to implement it myself? Following is an example of my usage.

ideal:
```
matricies = []
for i in range(num):
        data, row, col = cp.random.rand(size),  cp.random.rand(size),  cp.random.rand(size)
        coo_matrix = cupyx.scipy.sparse.coo_matrix(data, (row, col)
        matricies.append(coo_matrix )
block = cupyx.scipy.sparse.block_diag(matricies)
```

Currently, I have to diag block it with scipy and transfer it to GPU, lossing a lot of performance.
```
matricies = []
for i in range(num):
        data, row, col = np.random.rand(size),  np.random.rand(size),  np.random.rand(size)
        coo_matrix = scipy.sparse.coo_matrix(data, (row, col)
        matricies.append(coo_matrix )
block = scipy.sparse.block_diag(matricies)
block_cp = cupyx.scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(block)
```

Thanks
