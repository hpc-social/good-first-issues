Figured I'd open a meta-issue for discussion of cool stuff that's been done with Makie, and packages that use the Makie/AbstractPlotting ecosystem!  ]

Here's a package:

https://github.com/JuliaHolomorphic/ComplexPhasePortrait.jl

and areally cool logo made by @briochemc:
https://gist.github.com/briochemc/59a84810f70911aab6a23293aebd92c7#file-aibecs_logo-jl
(although that requires https://github.com/briochemc/WorldOceanAtlasTools.jl which is currently unregistered)

Please feel free to add more cool stuff below!
