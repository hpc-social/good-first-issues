Hi, I came across the Mathieu functions and could not get the values from scipy.special.mathieu_cem in accordance with the solutions of the corresponding differential equation.

for q == 0 one should get simply cos(sqrt(a) \* t), but what scipy.special.mathieu_cem returns is more like cos(a \* t). So I assumed that the order parameter a is just defined differently. but then still the solutions for q != 0 do not math. wolfram alpha gives results close to the ones I got from solving the differential equation.

So I conclude the Mathieu functions in scipy are either wrong or do not correspond to the standard definition (see wikipedia, wolfram)

Cheers, Richard
