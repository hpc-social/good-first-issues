Hi All, 

This PR can be merged so I will go ahead. However, we need to clarify the rules concerning the color ([0-1], vs [0-255]).

Let's create an issue to remember that we need to handle the color in all actors. I suppose, there is a function for that in utils.py or we need to create it.

We also need to manage the out of bounds
