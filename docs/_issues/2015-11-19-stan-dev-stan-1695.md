The base class `variational::base_family` has no virtual methods and the one function it does define uses no member variables or functions, so can be made standalone outside of the class.  Therefore, `base_family` should be removed.
- [ ] remove `src/stan/variational/base_family.hpp`
- [ ] move function `write_error_msg_()` into its own file and rename without suffix `_`  
- [ ] patch `families/normal_meanfield.hpp` and `families/normal_fullrank.hpp`:
  - [ ] remove references to `base_family`
  - [ ] change calls to `write_error_msg_` to include and call new function

If the intent was to somehow pull down some of the functionality from the subclasses, then this issue should be repurposed to do that.
