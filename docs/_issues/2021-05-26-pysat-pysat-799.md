**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
It can be necessary to pull out the instrument sampling rate from data. In principle this should be easy but data gaps, instrument turn on/off, etc. can potentially frustrate this determination.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It may be necessary for `calc_res` in `utils.time` to support different averaging methods for data sets currently unseen.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Leave it alone.

**Additional context**
