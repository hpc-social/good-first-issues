I was recently porting a Matlab example to julia and I realized there's no direct equivalence.

I extended the floor function in my code snippet by doing:
```julia
import Base.floor
floor(x::Complex) = floor(real(x)::Real) + 1im*floor(imag(x)::Real)
```

I'm not sure if this would be a welcome addition, but it would surely make Julia code more similar to other well-used scientific software.
