I spent some time yesterday and today trying to get tests to run on old versions of Matplotlib which....was harder than I wished it would be.  We may want to have one very pinned requirements file (possible managed by one of the auto-bump services ðŸ˜ž or tools) that we rename to `fully-pinned-v3.6.x.txt` on branching.  We can then use that (exclusively) for tests on the backport branch which should hopefully reduce the amount of dep-only backports we have to do (and provide a useful reference for anyone who wants to get old versions testing again).
