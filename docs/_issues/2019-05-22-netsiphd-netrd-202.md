There are some methods that have parameterizations that have different behavior; these are not always tested explicitly in the test suites, where we tend to favor the defaults. Examples:

* Correlation matrix (regularization)
* Laplacian distances (kernel, norm, etc.)

I'm sure there are others. Ideally we would have a full account of these and make sure they are fully covered by the tests.
