## Reason
<!--Why do you need this feature or what is the enhancement?-->
Currently, syntax like `[foo.i]` will automatically create a link with popup to the source code, the mechanism for this is fragile because it is required to fall through for traditional markdown shortcut syntax.

## Design
<!--A concise description (design) of what you want to happen.--->
The autolink.py extension of MooseDocs should define a command for this rather than trying to be automatic: `[!file](foo.i)`

## Impact
<!--Will the enhancement change existing public APIs, internal APIs, or add something new?-->
The documentation for moose and the apps will need to be updated, but the current method can be deprecated first while the update happens.
