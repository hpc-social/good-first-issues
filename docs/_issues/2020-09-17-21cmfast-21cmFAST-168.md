**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Presently, lightcone quantities are fixed along the z-direction. Which means `perturb_field.velocity` can only return the z-component of the velocity. Related to #167.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Obtaining all 3 components (x, y, z) of the perturbed velocity field should be accessible. However, it is best to avoid having all 3 components accessible at all times (for memory reasons). Thus there should be an option to keep all three components when required, otherwise only keep the line-of-sight direction for constructing lightcones.

Equally, it should be theoretically possible to construct lightcones along any direction, not just the z-direction. Default should be the z-direction, but the user should have the ability to define the preferred direction, i.e. x-, y- or z- direction.
