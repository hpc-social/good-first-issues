I ran the following example taken from the py21cmfast.wrapper but I immediately got a 
ValueError: do_spin_temp is not a valid parameter of global_params
```
import py21cmfast as p21
all_boxes = p21.run_coeval(redshift=[7,8,9], 
                           user_params=p21.UserParams(HII_DIM=100),
                           flag_options=p21.FlagOptions(INHOMO_RECO=True),
                           do_spin_temp=True
                          )
```
