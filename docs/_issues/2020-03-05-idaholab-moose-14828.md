## Reason
<!--Why do you need this feature or what is the enhancement?-->
The level set module relies on the velocity, it would be best if used a vector variable for this connection.

## Design
<!--A concise description (design) of what you want to happen.--->
The level set kernels just need to be changed the the new variable type and the old method be deprecated.

## Impact
<!--Will the enhancement change existing public APIs, internal APIs, or add something new?-->
The only impact is that the old velocity variables need to be deprecated
