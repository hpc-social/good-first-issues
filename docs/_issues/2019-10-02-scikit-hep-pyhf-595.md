# Description

We should provide some nice aliases to make things easier to use in `pyhf` overall such as:
- `pyhf.tb` to `pyhf.tensorlib`
- `pyhf.np` to `pyhf.tensor.numpy_backend`
- `pyhf.tf` to `pyhf.tensor.tensorflow_backend`
- `pyhf.opt` to `pyhf.optimizer`

and so on. These should all map to the longer name versions.
