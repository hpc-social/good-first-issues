## Reason
<!--Why do you need this feature or what is the enhancement?-->

This VPP records a piece of information and then several other attributes about that piece of information. This is precisely what the `SamplerBase` does. This VPP could be refactored to inherit from that post processor eliminating most of the code.

## Design
<!--A concise description (design) of what you want to happen.--->

Make ElementVariablesDifferenceMax VPP inherit from SamplerBase

## Impact
<!--Will the enhancement change existing public APIs, internal APIs, or add something new?-->
