This is based on a comment from the hackathon in berlin - right now our empty state (after launching the workers / connecting to a cluster) is basically just the browse button kind of shyly  hidden away on the top left below the logo - we could make much better use of the empty state. 

On one hand, we can present the "browse" action as a much more prominent call to action. On the other hand, we could also put some project-specific links and "actions" there, like "If you are using LiberTEM in your work, please [cite](https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/citing.html) us", or "Please star us on GitHub" etc., or "Give us feedback by opening an issue" (wording to be improved).

Some of these could also be put into a permanent footer.
