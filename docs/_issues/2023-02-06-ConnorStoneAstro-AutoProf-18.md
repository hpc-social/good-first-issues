**describe the content in question**

All AutoProf methods require docstrings, these should be formatted in google notation. This notation is easily readable in text format as well, making it useful for help strings at the interpreter level as well.

**example use case**

Example google notation docs can be seen here:
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html

**brief outline of updated documentation**

This only applies to docstrings
