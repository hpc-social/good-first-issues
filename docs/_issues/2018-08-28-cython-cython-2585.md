These came up in CPython [issue 34508](https://bugs.python.org/issue34508). We should make sure that we support them as well, and follow whatever they decide over there.
```
    def f(): return *(1, 2), 3

    eval('*(1, 2), 3')

    a = []; a += *(1, 2), 3

    for i in *(1, 2), 3: pass

    def g(): yield *(1, 2), 3
```

1) write tests and find out if they work or not, see the `extended_unpacking` tests.
2) find the places in the parser (`Parsing.py`) where these are disallowed, see the [hacker guide](https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/HackerGuide#getting-started)
3) fix the parsing issues, find out what else is not working for whatever reason.

Don't hesitate to submit an incomplete PR and ask for further guidance.
