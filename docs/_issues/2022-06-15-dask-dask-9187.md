title: "Standardize reporting known inconsistencies in `dask.dataframe` API"
html_url: "https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/9187"
user: rrpelgrim
repo: dask/dask

**Current situation**
Portions of the `dask.dataframe` API are copied over directly from `pandas` using the `@derived_from` decorator. This pulls in the pandas docstring for the corresponding object and adds the "This docstring was copied from pandas. Some inconsistencies with the Dask version may exist."

**Problem** 
New users often find the vagueness in this docstring confusing and intimidating -- Are there really inconsistencies? How many of them? What are they?

**Proposed Situation**
- Adopt a standardised method for reporting known inconsistencies. I've made a first attempt in #9177  - this format is very much open to discussion.
- Launch an organised effort to comb through the `dask.dataframe` API systematically to report known inconsistencies wherever possible. I'm not really sure what the best way to do this would be - perhaps a meta-issue or item in the overall Dask project board (if that exists?)

This process could be replicated for `dask.array`
