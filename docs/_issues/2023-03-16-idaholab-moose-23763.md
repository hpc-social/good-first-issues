title: "MooseDocs media extension doesn't throw an error if there is a syntax issue in an option"

## Bug Description
In the [MooseDocs media extension](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/python/MooseDocs/extensions/media.html), parameters can be set on or off with booleans. For example, controls can be enabled in a video with `controls=True`. However, when there is a syntax error (example, `controls=True;`), MooseDocs simply ignores the faulty setting and defers to the default behavior for the option. This can make it very difficult for new users to the docs system to determine what is going wrong when media isn't building and behaving as they expect. 

## Steps to Reproduce
Build the MOOSE website, but beforehand, in `moose/modules/doc/content/index.md` make the following modification in the syntax for the twisting wire animation:

```
!media gallery/twist_dark.mp4 style=width:100%; controls=False autoplay=True; loop=True
```
Notice that the website builds without an error or a warning, and the media doesn't autoplay. 

## Impact
This is an annoyance, and could lead to confusion for new users.
