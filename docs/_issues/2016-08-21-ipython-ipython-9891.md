sometimes we just want to temporarily check some info and don't like to make our console dirty. like `%whos` mentioned in this [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5740835/how-to-use-pipe-in-ipython). another case can be someone types `%hist` to remind himself. So I suggest add an option to those magics such that users can display the output in pager.
