**Bug summary**

I was trying to create a polymer using the polymer builder, and ran into some buggy behavior. Essentially, I have a single bead that I want to act as the monomer, and it already has oriented ports. I have to use the replace=False argument, but then the add_monomer() method is trying to add ports that are already there. However, this method works if I had the monomer directly to the polymer class. So I wanted to make sure these methods are consistent and allow the user to do what they want either way.


**Code to reproduce the behavior**

Please include a code snippet that can be used to reproduce this bug.

```python
import mbuild as mb
class _CH3(mb.Compound):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = "_CH3"
        
        """Create a particle name _CH3 and add it to self."""
        _ch3 = mb.Compound()
        self.add(_ch3)
        
        
        """Create a port attached to the _CH3 particles, label as 'up'.
        Use the separation value of the _CH2's ports as above.
        """
        port_up = mb.Port(anchor=_ch3, orientation=[0, 0, 1], separation=0.07)
        self.add(port_up, label="up")


class _CH2(mb.Compound):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = "_CH2"
        """Create a partilce name _CH2 and add it to self."""
        _ch2 = mb.Compound()
        self.add(_ch2)
        
        
        """Create a port attached to the _CH2 particles, label as 'up'."""
        port_up = mb.Port(anchor=_ch2, orientation=[0, 0, 1], separation=0.07)
        self.add(port_up, "up")
        
        
        """Create a port attached to the _CH2 particles, label as 'down',
        with same separation but opposite orientation as 'up port'
        """
        port_down = mb.Port(anchor=_ch2, orientation=[0, 0, -1], separation=0.07)
        self.add(port_down, "down")


_ch2 = _CH2()
_ch3 = _CH3()
polymer_works = Polymer(monomers=[_CH2()]
polymer_works.build(n=5) 

polymer_broken = Polymer()
polymer_broken.add_monomer(CH2(), replace=False, indices=[0,0], orientation=[[0,0,1], [0,0,-1]], separation=2.5)
polymer_broken.build(n=5)
```

Output
```

    733 else:

MBuildError: Label "up" already exists in <_CH2 1 particles, 0 bonds, non-periodic, id: 6307720976>.
```


I think there needs to be a way to use add_monomer that works equivalently to when the polymer class is initialized.
