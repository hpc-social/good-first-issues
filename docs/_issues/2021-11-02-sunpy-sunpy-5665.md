I'm currently reading in a decent (~300) amount of CDF files with `sunpy.timeseries.TimeSeries`. It takes ~1 minute, so it would be nice to get some feedback on progress. Perhaps we could add a `verbose` flag, which if enabled will spin up a `tqdm` progress bar that counts through the number of files loaded so far?
