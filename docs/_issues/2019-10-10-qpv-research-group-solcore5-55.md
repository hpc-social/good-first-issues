[Type annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) are an invaluable resource to inform the user what a function or method expect as inputs and will provide as output. It can also help to identify problems using tools like [mypy](http://www.mypy-lang.org). 

Solcore lacks completely of type annotations. 

Annotate everything is an enormous undertaking and it might be very complicated at times, with confusing or custom made objects serving as inputs/outputs. But it can be done bit by bit. Any progress along these lines will be very helpful for the long term sustainability of Solcore.
