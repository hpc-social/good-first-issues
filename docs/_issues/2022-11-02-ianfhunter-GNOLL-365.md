Fate of the Norns RPG contains runes instead of dice which are drawn from a bag. This does use a mechanic of "picking/drawing" that is outside GNOLL's scope because of state tracking, but it would be useful to have macros for these runes so that it will be easier to play this game with GNOLL + some additional logic.

The runes are below and their colour/blankness is important. There are 24 in total.

See [The general Macro Ticket](https://github.com/ianfhunter/GNOLL/issues/338) for how to add a macro
