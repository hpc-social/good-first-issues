**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The Results class has quite a few nifty features now, and it would be great to have a tutorial to show them off. It will make it easier for users to do any custom calculations. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Documentation showing useful features like `labels`, `data`, `param_idx`, and how to link to the `system` class to compute orbits (e.g., for making orbit predicitons). 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Answering individual emails from people who have questions about it

**Additional context**
