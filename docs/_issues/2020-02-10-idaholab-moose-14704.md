## Reason
For mechanical calculations we frequently require second order elements to avoid locking issues (volumetric and shear locking). Currently there seems to be no easy way to generate second order meshes (with either generators directly supporting second order or as a generator that transforms a first order mesh to a second order mesh)

## Design
The low hanging fruit would be a generator that uses the libmesh functionality for turning first order elements into second order elements. Note that this might not result in an optimal geometry 
as the mid nodes would just be linearly interpolated.

## Impact
Capability for second order mesh generation.
