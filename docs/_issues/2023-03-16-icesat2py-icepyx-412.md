During the JOSS review we identified a few new-ish tools and updates to add to our [ICESat-2 Resource Guide](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/resources.html#resource-ref-label):
- [ ] update instructions for getting to NSIDC ICESat-2 data tools (they've recently redone their website)
- [ ] add [read-icesat-2](https://read-icesat-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to the list of open-source packages
- [ ] do a quick GitHub search to identify other repos that should be added to the list
