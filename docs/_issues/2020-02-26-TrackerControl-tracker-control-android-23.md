@bege10: BusinessCalendar2 allows to download school holiday calendars. This only works if I deactivate blocking for that app in TC. There are no trackers listed for that app in TC.
Additionally ProfiMail Go (mail client) does not connect correctly to t-online.de (IMAP, starts with a few folders and then hangs) and not at all to gmx.de (POP3, but there is a tracker listed for United Internet Media which hosts GMX). After deactivating blocking in TC all accounts work correct.
