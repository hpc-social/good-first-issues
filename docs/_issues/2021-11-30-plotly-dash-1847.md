**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Radioitem and checklist options typically have short labels so sometimes it would be helpful to add a descriptive tooltip to them. For a user-defined label, this is possible via `html.Label(title="â€¦")`. For labels created through `RadioItem` or `Checklist`, this does not seem possible.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In addition to `disabled`, `label`, `value`, allow setting the `title` on an option.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I've seen [a workaround using dbc](https://github.com/facultyai/dash-bootstrap-components/issues/377) but apart from requiring the bootstrap components, that solution is somewhat complicated and does not match the workflow of the `html.Label` component.
