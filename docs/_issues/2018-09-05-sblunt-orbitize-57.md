This might be something @logan-pearce is interested in working on. In particular, I think we should implement the following:
- use a scipy optimization routine to estimate the minimum chi square for a given dataset, then use that to calculate a modified chi square for each tested orbit.
- adaptively modify priors as regions of parameter space are ruled out.
