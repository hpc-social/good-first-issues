Extention of the doc string of "mechkit.notation.ExplicitConveter"
by representations of stiffnesses and compliances in
- [ ] Voigt
- [ ] UMAT
- [ ] VUMAT

notation would be a huge improvement.

Currently, some placeholder "todos" show where additional views may be placed.

Inspiration for the representations may be given by these views (actually the stiffness-representation for Voigt notation is included in the below screenshot)
