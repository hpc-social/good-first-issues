## Reason
<!--Why do you need this feature?-->

It would be very handy to have checkpoint files written automatically for all simulations based on elapsed wall time. This is somewhat analogous to the "autosave" feature found in many desktop applications. Users that encounter failures would be able to restart their simulations from a previous checkpoint file and continue running.

## Design
<!--A concise description (design) of what you want to happen.--->

The design for this system is straightforward. We already have "interval" parameter that writes out files every <n> time steps. This Boolean triggers whether or not the checkpoint object actually dumps a file or not. I would propose that we have a new "time-based" option that would trigger the existing Boolean so that it would be written at a reasonable interval (5 or perhaps even 10 mins of time). 

The other part of the design would require that we change the `CommonOutputAction` to setup checkpoint format by default. Additionally, we'd have to make sure that we don't collide with explicit checkpoint formats added by the user (or TestHarness).

## Impact
<!--Will the enhancement change existing public APIs, internal APIs, or add something new?-->
Moderate: New feature with high impact on usability
