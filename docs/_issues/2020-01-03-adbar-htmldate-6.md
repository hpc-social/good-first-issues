A short version of the documentation is available straight from Github ([README.rst](https://github.com/adbar/htmldate/blob/master/README.rst)) while a more exhaustive one is present in the `docs` folder and online on [htmldate.readthedocs.io](https://htmldate.readthedocs.io)

Several problems could arise:

- Non-idiomatic use of English (not quite fluent or natural)
- Unclear or incomplete descriptions
- Code examples that don't work
- Typos in explanations or code sections
- Outdated sections
