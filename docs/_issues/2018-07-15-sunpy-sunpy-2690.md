This is currently broken.

```python
import sunpy.data.sample as sp
import sunpy.map
with open(sp.AIA_171_IMAGE) as fd:
    sunpy.map.Map(fd)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
  File "/home/nabil/Git/sunpy/sunpy/map/map_factory.py", line 279, in __call__
    data_header_pairs, already_maps = self._parse_args(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/home/nabil/Git/sunpy/sunpy/map/map_factory.py", line 237, in _parse_args
    raise ValueError("File not found or invalid input")
ValueError: File not found or invalid input
```

We need to check what happens with TimeSeries as well.
