title: "allow sampling of posterior outside of prior bounds"

currently, sampling from posterior rejects samples outside of the prior bounds (by design, due to leakage), but it may be useful to optionally allow sampling outside of the bounds with a flag in `posterior.sample()` or as an additional parameter in `rejection_sampling_parameters`
