#### Summary:

Add a function to compute the bivariate normal cdf.  

#### Description:

For size 2 vectors `y` and `mu` and 2 x 2 covariance matrix `Sigma`, compute

```
bivar_normal_cdf(y, mu, Sigma)

  = INT_{u < y}  multinormal_pdf(u, mu, Sigma) d.u
```

where `u` is also a 2-vector and `u < y` is defined componentwise as `u[1] < y[1] && u[2] < y[2]`.

There could also be a parameterization where covariance is given in terms of two scale parameters and a correlation parameter.
