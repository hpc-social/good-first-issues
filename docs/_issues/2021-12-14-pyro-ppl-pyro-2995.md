NumPyro now has several excellent introductory [examples](http://num.pyro.ai/en/stable/) with no direct counterparts in Pyro. Porting one of these to Pyro would be a great way for someone to simultaneously learn more about Bayesian data analysis and make a valuable open source contribution.

If you are reading this and want to give one of them a try, please leave a comment here so that other people are aware of your work and so we can help you get started!

Bonus points if you can modify an example to use variational inference with Pyro's [autoguides](https://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/infer.autoguide.html) rather than MCMC while obtaining similar results.
