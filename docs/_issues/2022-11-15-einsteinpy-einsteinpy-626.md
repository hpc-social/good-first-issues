### 🐞 **Problem**
We need new [example notebooks](https://github.com/einsteinpy/einsteinpy/tree/main/docs/source/examples) or edits to older notebooks to highlight the feature additions and API changes that EinsteinPy has seen over the years. Recently, two PRs added features that could use a notebook demonstrating them. This issue will track multiple features of EinsteinPy that should be properly documented.
- [ ] PR #625 added support for custom metrics functions, outside of electro-vacuum (EV) solutions. We need one or two examples showcasing this (preferably with a non-EV metric).
- [ ] PR #612 (issue #610) improved scaling in geodesic plots. Most of the related example notebook were updated (See discussion in #612), but [one](https://github.com/einsteinpy/einsteinpy/blob/main/docs/source/examples/Visualizing%20Precession%20in%20Schwarzschild%20Spacetime.ipynb) had to be left out at the time due to merge conflicts. It can be edited now.
- [ ] *More to be added*
