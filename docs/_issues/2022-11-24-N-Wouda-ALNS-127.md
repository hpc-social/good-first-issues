[Máximo et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11021v1) implements a threshold-based acceptance criterion. They do not give a specific name, but the threshold changes adaptively during the search, which is why I named it "adaptive threshold". 

>This threshold is calculated according to the average quality of the solutions obtained after the local search, which is denoted by $\bar{f}$.
