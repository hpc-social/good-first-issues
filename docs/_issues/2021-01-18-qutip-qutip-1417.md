**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
For coherent states of large average photon number it is convenient to use the `offset` parameter as in http://qutip.org/docs/latest/apidoc/functions.html?highlight=wigner#qutip.states.coherent

However, `wigner` and others do not support that parameter and would just give wrong results.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Functions like http://qutip.org/docs/latest/apidoc/functions.html?highlight=wigner#qutip.wigner.wigner , http://qutip.org/docs/latest/apidoc/functions.html?highlight=wigner#qutip.visualization.plot_wigner_fock_distribution , and others could support an `offset` parameter or the `offset` parameter can be stored in the qobject.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Calculating these functions manually. It works but it is pretty annoying.
