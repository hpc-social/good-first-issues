This is a minor UI issue. In master, it seems like the `B` of the bash kernel is too close to the upper border of the square in the launcher pad.

It used to look like this is JL 2.x

And related: Why is the B orange for the notebook but blue for the kernel, while the Python and Julia logos are the same colors? I guess maybe because the notebook and console icons have those colors and it was more fun with different colors since there was no real logo for bash? Lately (in 2015), an official bash logo was created, which could be used if desired over the `B`, details here https://bashlogo.com/.
