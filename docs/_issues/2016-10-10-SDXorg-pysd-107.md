It would be good to do an integration test of all of the random functions we support:
- "lognormal": "np.random.lognormal",
- "random normal": "functions.bounded_normal", 
- "poisson": "np.random.poisson",
- "exprnd": "np.random.exponential", 
- "random uniform": "functions.random_uniform",

The challenge is that our testing infrastructure matches values at each timestep, and that won't work with random functions. 

Lack of this sort of testing leads to issues like https://github.com/JamesPHoughton/pysd/issues/105.
