I have a few cython modules that currently get integer type definitions from numpy using `from numpy cimport int64_t, int32_t`.  Related to #2569, I would prefer to remove the numpy dependency and just use `from libc.stdint cimport int64_t, int32_t`.  Naturally this works on OSX/Linux but fails on Windows.

pandas has a shim for stdint on Windows: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/_libs/src/headers/stdint.h

Would it make sense for this to be done upstream in cython?
