Since mlpack-bot is ruthless about closing stale issues and PRs (although that is my fault :)), I wanted to make a place where we can list PRs that have been closed for inactivity, but could still have useful functionality that could be merged, if someone was willing to either (a) handle the unresolved comments on the PR or (b) give a comprehensive review to the PR (and then we can reopen it, if the original author is still interested).

I'm hoping this is better than just leaving the stale PRs open indefinitely---it should keep the PR list from getting too long.  If anyone else has any old PRs they'd like to see eventually merged, I can add them to the list here.

If you're looking for a place to start contributing to mlpack, this could be a good issue: just take a look through the PRs listed below as well as any comments, and see if any of those PRs are interesting to you.  If so, see if you can figure out what the current status of that PR is, and if there are comments that need to be addressed, then you can address those starting from the current code and open a new PR (and hopefully we can review it).

Here's the list:

 - #1072: Implementation of Neural Turing Machine [likely needs update to any API changes]
 - #1367: NMF: allow user to specify one of W/H matrices [very useful functionality!]
 - #1842: change weak learner type of the Adaboost to DecisionTree::ID3DecisionStump [allows lots of code simplification when we're done]
