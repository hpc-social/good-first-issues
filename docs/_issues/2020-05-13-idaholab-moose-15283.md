## Bug Description
There is a large set of tests of deprecated `mesh_generator` objects that are failing the deprecated test target, but they all have `deprecated=true` set in their `tests` file.

## Steps to Reproduce
Look at any recent deprecated test target:
https://civet.inl.gov/job/524228/

## Impact
We need this fixed to keep the deprecated test target passing. This isn't a hard fail, but this masks other issues that come up, so it needs to be fixed.
