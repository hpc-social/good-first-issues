### What is the expected enhancement?

Right now our documentation is mainly focused on api references with some small examples in the class documentation and release notes. It would be great if we had a user guide in the documentation top explain at a higher level how to interact with retworkx, working with graphs/networks, and accomplishing some concrete tasks using retworkx. Some good examples of documentation like this:

- https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide.html
- https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html

Writing documentation like this will also be good for exposing any API or functionality gaps in retworkx.
