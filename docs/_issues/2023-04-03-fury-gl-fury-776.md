As shown in the following image, the TabUI starts in collapsed mode.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

-  It would be helpful and more intuitive if the default behavior of this UI component would be the opposite yet still provide a parameter to initialize it collapsed for some applications.
- Additionally, it would be great to have the option to collapse/expand by double-clicking on any tab or single clicking on the active tab.
