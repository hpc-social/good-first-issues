http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.17.0/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.cg.html (and other solvers too) currently defines the preconditioner M as "The preconditioner should approximate the inverse of A."
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method#Convergence_properties_of_the_conjugate_gradient_method) and [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pcg.html) both seem to use the inverse definition (i.e. they solve `M^-1.A.x=M^-1.y`).
Both definitions seem to exist in the literature(?) but (assuming that the note is correct) I think it would be helpful to clarify which M is meant there ("Note: the definition of the preconditioner matches the definition in reference XYZ, and is the inverse of the definition in reference XYZ'.")
