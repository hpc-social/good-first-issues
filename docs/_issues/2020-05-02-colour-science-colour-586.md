I would be useful to implement support for various photoreceptor models so that it is possible to generate custom cone fundamentals down the road. I have started with Caroll et al. (2000), Stockman and Sharpe (2000), Lamb (1995) photoreceptor models in that notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1snhtUdUxUrTnw_B0kagvfz015Co9p-xv

We will obviously need support for various pre-receptoral filter functions.
