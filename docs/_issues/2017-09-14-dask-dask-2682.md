Dask uses a couple `assert_eq` helpers for easily testing the equality of the result of a computation (a `dask.array` or `dask.dataframe` say) to the expected value (`np.array`, `pd.DataFrame)`. It'd be nice to have some tests for these helpers to ensure they're functioning properly

- array: https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/a1a75a766243f1f84ac1df502de3faf8ce4ebc81/dask/array/utils.py#L62
- dataframe: https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/a1a75a766243f1f84ac1df502de3faf8ce4ebc81/dask/dataframe/utils.py#L553

See https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/2681/files#diff-20d741e3b309789af8da0fbc2663f964 for an example of the kinds of tests we would be good to have.
