BUG REPORT INFORMATION
---------------------------------------------------
Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment:
You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST

**NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed
in more current versions of the project.  Before reporting an issue, please verify the
version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release
documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md).  If they differ, please
update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating
an issue.

Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md),
please reference that page before opening a new issue.

If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug
against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build
executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah
maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs.

**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)**

/kind bug


**Description**

<!--
Briefly describe the problem you are having in a few paragraphs.
-->

Variables defined in the `env` section are not expanded in the `command`/`args` section.  According to [the k8s spec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#container-v1-core), env vars should be expanded using the `$(VAR_NAME)` syntax.

**Steps to reproduce the issue:**

1. Define a file called `test.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
---
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: echo
  labels:
    app: echo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test
      env:
        - key: FOO
          value: BAR
      image: docker.io/library/alpine:latest
      command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - echo
        - $(FOO)
```

2.  verify result by running `podman play kube test.yaml && podman logs -f echo-test`

**Describe the results you received:**

no output


**Describe the results you expected:**

"BAR" to be printed


**Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):**

I also tried printing `$(PATH)` instead of `$(FOO)` and there was still no output.
