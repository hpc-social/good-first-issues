### Description

As suggested from workshop, it would be nice to have the data units (e.g. cts, etc) printed on the .peek() histogram (pixel value plot) and maybe added to the colorbar of a map when plotted

or:

The units of a map are accessible via .unit. This is included in the peek colorbar, but not in the fancy html repr. It would be nice to include this too, maybe just as an additional entry in the table on the left.
