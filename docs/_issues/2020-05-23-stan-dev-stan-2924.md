#### Summary:

It'd be nice to have a builder pattern for var contexts to make them easy to construct for testing.  Something that could be used like this:

```
MatrixXd m(3, 2); 
...
var_context vc
  = var_context::builder()
    .matrix("a", m)
    .real("f", 2.3)
    .build();
```

#### Current Version:
v2.23.0
