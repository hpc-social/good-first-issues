I don't know that it's always preceded by "section", but maybe we can create an issue suggesting adding links to the OpenAPI descriptions and leave it for later to not block the release of `v1.0.0-rc.2`?

As seen in the quote above, I tried implementing this already in #351, however, due to the pressing release of `v1.0.0-rc.2` of the OPTIMADE API specification, this addition was considered non-essential and too time consuming to implement in that PR.

Instead it has now become this issue, to track the progress of adding the various hyperlinks.
