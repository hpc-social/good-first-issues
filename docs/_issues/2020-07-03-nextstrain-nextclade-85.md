As a part of the experiment with persistent informational widgets (#83), we would like to try to trigger tooltips on click and/or focus (in addition to hover). When tootltip is triggered this way it will stay even after mouse left the triggering element. It will be dismissed after the element looses focus (e.g. if clicked somewhere else)

We may consider to keep the sticky tooltip as it is, or we can trigger a different popover widget instead.
