The current solar cell solvers are designed to calculate the quantum efficiency, IV curves of band structure of the devices. However, they can also provide information about other derived quantities, most notably photoluminescence and electroluminescence. While all the information needed is already there, accessing it is a bit cumbersome.

An easy way of accessing all that information will be very helpful to compare with experimental data.
