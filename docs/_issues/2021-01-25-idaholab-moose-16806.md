## Reason
For some of the shepard apps like direwolf, it's nice to check that all the modules are working. A while back @andrsd  suggested something like `./run_tests --spec-file bison`, which works fine. It would be nice to automatically check all submodules instead of individually doing each submodule? For example, direwolf has 8 total submodules, making it easy to forget which have been tested. This is much easier than building each submodule and running tests. Furthermore, it ensures that the current executable does everything expected of it (test-wise that is).

## Design
Maybe add run_tests script option like `./run_tests --submodules` that uses the current executable to run the tests in all the submodules.

## Impact
Easy user checking to make sure all submodules are working correctly.
