From https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4340#issuecomment-656253760:


> I wonder if it would be an interesting feature/extension for the nooa TimeSeries class, to can handle also other json files (with t.s.) from https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/. For example https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/goes/ (/primary/xrays-1-day.json) contain json timeseries for soft x-rays provided in real time (contrary to the goes.py class where the fits files are available after 1-2 days). I think this may be something interesting for the sunpy user to have. I attach a simple example of how I process and plot this xrays-1-day.json file, similarly it works for for the other xrays-?-day.json files. Something similar could be tailored to the noaa class, right?
