I just observed that when I am using any function from `mirapy.data.load_dataset`, the module always runs `from keras.utils.np_utils import to_categorical` which is only used in one function. So if a user just wants to load dataset and doesn't have keras installed, it will throw an error. This is a utility that needs to be replaced by either creating our own `to_categorical` function or find a better way.
