The tree page containing phylogenetic tree rendered by Auspice takes a couple of seconds to navigate to.

In Nextstrain, it does not seem to be the case, even if a much bigger tree is rendered there, plus other widgets:

Or maybe the pause is hidden behind the loader spinner?

We need to investigate the reason of slowdown and try to make navigation faster. If not, then at least mask it with the loading spinner too.
