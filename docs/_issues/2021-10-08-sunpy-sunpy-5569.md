Originally suggested in https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/5501#discussion_r724886420. Currently we do the following correction:

```python
        if ctype1.lower() in ("solar-x", "solar_x"):
            ctype1 = 'HPLN-TAN'

        if ctype2.lower() in ("solar-y", "solar_y"):
            ctype2 = 'HPLT-TAN'
```
We should deprecate this, and eventually remove it. If any particular map sources depend on this fix, it should move into the map source.
