**Describe the behavior you would like added to mBuild**
I need to ask somebody to migrate a small repo into an mBuild recipe and the best documentation (barring me explaining it myself) is buried in a PR: https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild/pull/501#issue-259540754

**Describe the solution you'd like**
More thorough documentation, and probably an example of its use (i.e. https://github.com/ftiet/droplet-builder/blob/27fecdd81d060f8c51b0c3fb8bd06c4f6c2c15c9/setup.py#L48). A cookiecutter would be great too.
