https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/types.html doesn't have the container types documented. Now `numba.objmode` is implemented and adheres to the context manager protocol, it's feasible that users would want to define types that leave an `objmode` block that are more complex than those covered by the current docs (which I think are largely in relation to type signatures for `{g,}ufuncs` ans so relatively primitive).
