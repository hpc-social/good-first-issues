#### Summary:
We would like to have asymmetric Laplace distribution to be implemented in stan.

#### Description:
As discussed in the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/stan-users/DUv_uFFedCM/329AeWxYtBAJ), it is particularly of interest for Bayesian quantile regression.

Also known as skewed Laplace distribution, the asymmetric Laplace distribution has an additional parameter `\tau (\tau \in [0,1])`

which reduces to Laplace distribution when `\tau=0.5`. 

With the Laplace distribution already in stan (named DoubleExponential), introducing asymmetric Laplace distribution is relatively straight forward.
