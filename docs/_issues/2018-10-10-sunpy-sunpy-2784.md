This came up in #2691 but has been an issue before hand. The general policy on time input is to run it through `sunpy.time.parse_time`, therefore the possible time-like inputs to most of the sunpy functions are very diverse in both type and format. The question raised in this issue is, how do we document this in our docstrings.

A form of the docstring should be like this:

```
Parameters
----------
name : `type`
    description
```
The main discussion here is what should go in the `type` section. It should be noted that this should *actually be a Python type*. Therefore I propose the following options:

* `astropy.time.Time`, `str`
* `astropy.time.Time`, `str`, `datetime.datetime`
etc

We **could** also do:

* `astropy.time.Time`, `str`, `~sunpy.time.parse_time`

but I feel like this is really pushing the intention of that part of the docstring.
