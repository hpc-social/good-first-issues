in /spatial/distance.py, the documentation for the function `jaccard` specify that parameters u and v are both
`(N,) array_like, bool
        Input array.`
Howerver, in /spatial/tests/test_distance.py, there are function calls to jaccard where u and v are floating point valued arrays, am I missing something or should these tests not be there?
