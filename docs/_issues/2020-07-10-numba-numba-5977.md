When testing the equality of two floating point numbers, it’s good practices to rely on approximations (e.g., `abs(a - b) < epsilon`) rather than on exact/bit-to-bit comparison.

In Python we can use [`math.isclose`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose) or [`numpy.isclose`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.isclose.html) to do such tests. These functions are a bit different but both can be equally useful. Unlike the built-in `math.isclose`, `numpy.isclose` is not symmetric in `a` and `b` – it assumes `b` is the reference value – so that `isclose(a, b)` might be different from `isclose(b, a)`.

* Floating point comparison is a common enough operation so that Numba can support it (for both `math` and `numpy` libraries).
* Moreover, all arguments of each function should be supported (relative tolerance, absolute tolerance, and `equal_nan` if existing) because each use case can have specific parameters.
