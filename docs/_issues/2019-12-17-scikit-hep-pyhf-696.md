# Description

When running xml2json, it's often configured that the input file prefix is `results/<analysis name>/<filename>.root` which is not necessarily something I make initially when I copy over the files. In these cases, I'd want `xml2json` to just search the directory I'm running in for the root file (i.e. using its basename).
