title: "Remove similar code for command-line argument handling"

## Reason
<!--Why do you need this feature?-->
The CommandLine::initForMultiApp method and the Parser::hitCLIFilter both have logic that is similar for separating MOOSE hit syntax from the supplied command-line arguments.

## Design
<!--A concise description (design) of what you want to happen.--->
These two methods should share a common code path or perhaps the use of one or the other can be removed. The reason for the current setup (see #13433) is to allow each MultiApp to have a unique CommandLine object.

## Impact
<!--Will the enhancement change existing public APIs, internal APIs, or add something new?-->
The main goal is to remove duplicate logic, any impact should be internal and not influence operation.
