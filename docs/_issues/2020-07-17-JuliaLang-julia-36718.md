I just noticed the `Random` stdlib has an `UnsafeView` type for filling arrays. With the new layout optimizations, this should no longer be necessary. We should try using the normal SubArray type for this. If it's still too slow/complex, then at least the type can be made safe by holding the underlying array directly instead of a `Ptr`.
