Sorry to reopen on a different issue

If have 3 independents priors 
```python
prior = process_prior([prior_oc, prior_s8, prior_w0] )
```
leading to `(MultipleIndependent(), 3, False)` , what about this error when I try to use the usual `prepare_for_sbi`
```python
#adapt/check the prior & simulator for SBI
simulator, prior = prepare_for_sbi(simulator, prior)
```
```
AssertionError: Nesting of combined distributions is not possible.
```
 how should I proceed? Thanks
