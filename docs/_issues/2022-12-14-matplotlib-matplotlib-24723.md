### Problem

#23606 moved a bunch of examples (annotate_simple01, ...) into the tutorial itself.  These examples are so short (and devoid of any explanatory text) that they can now be removed from the examples gallery and replaced by a redirect-from directive in the tutorial (to not break old links).

### Suggested improvement
