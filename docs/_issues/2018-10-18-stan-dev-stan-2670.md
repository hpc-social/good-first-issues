#### Summary:
Regarding the parameters of the dual averaging optimization for the stepsize in the warmup, all parameters can be set by the user except `mu`. For certain models, the initial choice of `mu` can result in a drastic drop of the stepsize for subsequent iterations. This might lead to extra computation time. As `mu` is adjusted for each window of the mass matrix adjustment, this can in effect add a significant amount of computation time.


#### Description:
Currently, `mu` is set to be `log(10 * this->nom_epsilon_)` which is hardcoded in the algorithm, and the services `stan::services::sample::hmc_static_dense_e_adapt`, `stan::services::sample::hmc_static_diag_e_adapt`, `stan::services::sample::hmc_nuts_dense_e_adapt` and `stan::services::sample::hmc_nuts_diag_e_adapt` do not expose the factor of `epsilon` to the user. This issue would entail 
* updating the services API, 
* adding the factor as an attribute to `stan::mcmc::stepsize_adaptation` with the corresponding getter and setter and 
* updating the corresponding parts in `stan::mcmc::adapt_dense_e_nuts`, `stan::mcmc::adapt_diag_e_nuts`, `stan::mcmc::adapt_dense_e_static_hmc` and `stan::mcmc::adapt_diag_e_static_hmc`.

There are also the equivalent algorithms in `nuts_classic`, `static_uniform` and `xhmc`.

The default factor of `10` should be kept.

#### Additional Information:
Issues in Rstan, Pystan and CmdStan would have to be opened as well.

#### Current Version:
v2.18.0
