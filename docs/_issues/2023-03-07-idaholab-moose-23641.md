## Reason
The MeshGenerator system could benefit from more detailed errors. #23353 is a significant improvement, but there still exists some room for improvement.

Examples (so far):
- detailing what to do in the case of an ambiguous final mesh generator (multiple independent endpoints)

## Design
Improve these errors, with detail on what can be done to resolve the problem.

## Impact
Better user experience.
