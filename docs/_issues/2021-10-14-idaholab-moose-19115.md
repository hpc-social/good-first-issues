title: "Add Option To Always Print A TIMED_SECTION"

## Reason
@aprilnovak reported that she would like the option to force the printing of any `TIMED_SECTION`.  This makes complete sense in the case where you always want to report to the user that something is complete.

## Design
Add another option (or another macro) to add this option to `TIMED_PRINT`

## Impact
None - new capability
