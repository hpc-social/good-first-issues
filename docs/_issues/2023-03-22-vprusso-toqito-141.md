The fidelity of separability (also known as the maximum separable fidelity [1, 2]) is an entanglement measure that can be approximated via semidefinite programs outlined in [3]. Ancillary files provided with [3] (here) implement SDPs that approximate the fidelity of separability.  

This task would entail:

1. Adding and generalizing the channel and density matrix SDPs from here and placing them into `state_metrics/fidelity_of_separability.py`. 
2. Adding corresponding unit tests in `tests/test_state_metrics/test_fidelity_of_separability.py`
3. Updating docs in `docs/states.rst` under "Distance Metrics for Quantum States"
