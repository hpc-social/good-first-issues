When filtering and/or sorting is applied to the results table(i.e. not all data is shown or shown in different order), we want to give user a visual reminder, for example in the form of a status panel or status bar with text showing what filters and what sort exactly are in use.

We may also display the number of rows shown and total number.

This is to prevent confusion, especially about hidden data rows.
