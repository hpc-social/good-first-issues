I tested the disable monitoring feature for Newpipe but it seemed to disable internet access for it. I don't know if this is a bug or just my understanding of how how it should work.

Android 10
TC 20201025 fdroid

Steps to reproduce
Disable monitoring for newpipe

Strict blocking is on but not sure if that is relevant or not

Expected results
Newpipe is not blocked or affected by TC.

Actual results
Newpipe can't load any videos
