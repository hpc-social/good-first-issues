When filtering and/or sorting are applied to the results table, we might give user a shortcut to reset these to default state (i.e. no filtering and sort by id column).

We might:

 - [ ] add button with "cross" icon for each text fields, these will remove this particular filter.
 - [ ] add global filter reset button that will reset all the filters
 - [ ] add sorting reset button that will sort the table by id (default sorting)
 - [ ] if status bar is implemented (#102) add  global reset buttons to it as well
