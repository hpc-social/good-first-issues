Consider adding binder for trying out sbi easily. I've create one for my fork of sbi. I had to remove the `environment.yml`, because binder hat trouble creating the docker (ERROR: File "setup.py" or "setup.cfg" not found. Directory cannot be installed in editable mode: /home/jovyan).

E.g. open a tutorial notebook from https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/schmitts/sbi/HEAD.
