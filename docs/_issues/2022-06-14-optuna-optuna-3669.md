### What is an issue?

There are several recommended settings for efficient batch optimization, such as the followings.

- set `popsize` to a multiple of batch size in `CmaEsSampler` (supported by #3649).
- set `constant_liar=True` in `TPESampler`.

We can add these points in [the tutorial of batch optimization](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/20_recipes/009_ask_and_tell.html#batch-optimization).
