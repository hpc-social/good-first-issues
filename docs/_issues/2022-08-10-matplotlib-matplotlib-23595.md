title: "[Bug]: `CbarAxesBase.toggle_label` doesn't seem to work properly"

### Bug summary

It appears as if `CbarAxesBase.toggle_label` and therefore, maybe, `SimpleAxisArtist.toggle` and possibly something else does not work as expected.

Probably related to the colorbar rewrite?

### Code for reproduction

https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/axes_grid1/demo_axes_grid.html

### Actual outcome

The two middle figures have visible tick labels for the color bar.

### Expected outcome

No visible tick labels.

### Additional information

There seems to be some sort of mismatch between the `_axisnum` property and the location of the labels. It seems to work if the labels are located at the same side as the colorbar, i.e., right and bottom.
