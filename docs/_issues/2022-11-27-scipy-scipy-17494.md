### Describe your issue.

Legacy [`setup.py`](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/main/scipy/optimize/_highs/setup.py) and [`meson.build`](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/main/scipy/optimize/_highs/meson.build) files specify C/C++ preprocessor directives that are unneeded/unused.  These were originally included to match flags added by the upstream cmake build system, but lead to increased maintenance burden trying to understand which flags are actually important and need to be updated.

The unused/unneeded build flags should be removed.

### Reproducing Code Example

```python

```
