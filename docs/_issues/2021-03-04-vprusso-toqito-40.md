Implement a function that calculates the min-relative entropy for quantum states. 

The functionality for this should be created in `state_props/min_relative_entropy.py` with corresponding unit tests found in `tests/test_state_props/test_min_relative_entropy.py`. Be sure to also update the docs in `/docs/states.rst` under "Properties of Quantum States" with `toqito.state_props.min_relative_entropy.py`.

For a definition of min-relative entropy for quantum states, consult:
