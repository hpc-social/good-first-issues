The MCBUR1 and MCBUR2 parameters are ambiguous. It's not clear, from the code or from knowledge of the Hurley papers, why they are named this way. They correspond to the bounds on the AGB core mass between which the CO core is partially degenerate. It would be useful to come up with clearer names for these parameters.

Separately, only MCBUR1 is an input option, but MCBUR2 should be added as an option as well.
