**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I always forget to update setup.py's version when making a github release - then the pip package does not get deployed

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Take the git tag (https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/26686) and replace it in the code before the publication step of the github action

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Can do it manually in the meanwhile

**Additional context**
