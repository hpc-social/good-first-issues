## Reason
<!--Why do you need this feature or what is the enhancement?-->

The ElementGenerator tests in `test/tests/meshgenerator/element_generator/` don't do a very good job of showing "useful" capability. There are two input files, one that generates a single element and one that generates two elements with two separate generators. In the second case, the elements touch but they create a duplicate node. This is generally not what a "new" user would probably want. Instead, we should probably show that you can generate a connected mesh and perhaps show that you can invoke a sticker for a case like we have now. Perhaps demonstrating that you can generate two disconnected subdomains might be another use case. 

## Design
<!--A concise description (design) of what you want to happen.--->

Improved test cases that better demonstrate the ElementGenerator's capabilities.

## Impact
<!--Will the enhancement change existing public APIs, internal APIs, or add something new?-->

Minor: Avoids confusion
