Here are a few examples that could easily be used to improve the docstrings and/or tutorial of scipy.signal: 

http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/FIRFilter
http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/FiltFilt
http://mpastell.com/2010/01/18/fir-with-scipy/ (IIRC @mpastell was OK with using that content, but I can't find an archived email that says that anymore. Matti can you confirm that this is OK?)

`signal.filtfilt` now has at least one nice example thanks to @WarrenWeckesser, and the tutorial is slowly improving mainly due to @endolith's PRs, but there's a ways to go....
