I don't know if this should be posted here since I already solved my issue, but I think it could be added to the documentation to prevent other people having the same problem. 

I tried to install cobrapy using pip directly into my computer (macOS Sierra) without virtualenv and I found that since the OS X capitan upgrade there have been some issues using pip (For more details see [How to use pip after the OS X El Capitan upgrade?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/209572/how-to-use-pip-after-the-os-x-el-capitan-upgrade))

I manage to install cobrapy only for my user which is not a problem since I'm the only user on this computer, using
`pip install --user cobra`

Also I wanted to ask if there is a more direct way to contribute to your documentation? 

Thanks!
