title: "The shifts for shiftImages should allow any number/type of spaces"

Currently, the x, y shifts must be separated by exactly one space.  One space, two spaces, 10 spaces, a tab, whatever, should work just the same.  The split currently splits on " ", just one space.  A "re" could be use instead.
