I just ran into an issue when trying to use `to_csv` with distributed workers that don't share a file system. I shouldn't have been surprised that writing to a local file system from a distributed worker doesn't work. It shouldn't work. But the error I got was just a `File Not Found` error. That brought me to:https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/2656#issuecomment-343903868 - which was the answer. 

I am wondering if dask might serve a more informative error in these (maybe) typical failure cases just to point people in the right direction. Does that seem reasonable?
