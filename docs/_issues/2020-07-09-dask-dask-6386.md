I think it might be helpful to add docstrings for `split_out` and `split_every` in the  dask groupby-aggregate API

We can probably add something 
```python
`split_out`:  Number of output results in group-by like aggergations (defaults to 1)
```
And use below for `split_every`

Happy to do a pr if `split_every's` docstring above is correct  for group-by and we feel it's fine to add both in places where `split_every/split_out` is present.
