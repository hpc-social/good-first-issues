From #5664:

> Adding the possibility of using `@njit` flags in `@cc.export` would be great! Is it possible?

and:

> I have managed to add the 'fastmath' flag to the `ExportEntry` object:
> 
> ```
> class ExportEntry(object):
>     """
>     A simple record for exporting symbols.
>     """
> 
>     def __init__(self, symbol, signature, function, fastmath=False):
>         self.symbol = symbol
>         self.signature = signature
>         self.function = function
>         self.fastmath = fastmath
> ```
> 
> Then, the `_cull_exports` methodof the `_ModuleCompiler` object shall me modified with the following code:
> 
> ```
> for entry in self.export_entries:
>             flags_aux = flags.copy()
>             if entry.fastmath:
>                 flags_aux.set('fastmath', value=cpu.FastMathOptions(True))
> 
>             cres = compile_extra(self.typing_context, self.context,
>                                  entry.function,
>                                  entry.signature.args,
>                                  entry.signature.return_type, flags_aux,
>                                  locals={}, library=library)
> ```
> 
> With this modifications, I am able to use the `@cc.export` decorator like this:
> 
> `@cc.export('foo', 'float64(float64[::1], float64[::1])', fastmath=True)`
> 
> And it is working for me right now. I guess this code may be improved, but this simple patch works, so I would expect that 'fastmath' and 'parallel' flags could be added to `@cc.export` in an "official" way.

The above could be worked up into a patch with tests added to complete the feature imp[lementation.
