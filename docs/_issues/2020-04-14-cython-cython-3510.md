The documentation on embedding is inherently lacking. Even the one in the [CPython docs](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html) is incomplete at best.

There are some hints [in the Wiki](https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/EmbeddingCython), there's the `--embed` option to the `cython` and `cythonize` frontends, the [embedding demo](https://github.com/cython/cython/tree/master/Demos/embed), the [`PyImport_AppendInittab()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/import.html#c.PyImport_AppendInittab) function in CPython and the documentation of the [module init function](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html#the-module-s-method-table-and-initialization-function) in CPython.

All of these are incomplete and none of them gives the whole picture in one place. There should be a dedicated documentation page in the Cython docs for this, and the documentation in the CPython docs is also worth improving.
