## Reason
<!--Why do you need this feature or what is the enhancement?-->
To aid in developer experience it would be useful to have the unit test automatically run from an application/module run_tests script.

## Design
<!--A concise description (design) of what you want to happen.--->
Add the ability within TestHarness.buildAndRun to enable the compile and running of units tests. There should also be an environment variable available to enable this per user

## Impact
<!--Will the enhancement change existing public APIs, internal APIs, or add something new?-->
This is a new feature and is optional, there will be no impact.
