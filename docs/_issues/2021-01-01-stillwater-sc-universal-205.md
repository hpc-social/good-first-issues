title: "Why do factorial approximations generate different values"

in the Sterling approximation of factorial(n), we use an oracle based on the sw::universal::decimal type, which is an adaptive data type, to generate a reference value. However, the direct approximation of the factorial through a native floating point type yields different approximations.

```
factorial(40) calculated with double and decimal oracle rounded to double

```

why is that the case?
