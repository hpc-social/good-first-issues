It should be possible to set the properties of a `KpointsData` directly in the constructor. Instead of having to write
```python
kpoints = KpointsData()
kpoints.set_kpoints_mesh([4,4,4])
builder.kpoints = kpoints
```
one should be able to write
```python
builder.kpoints = KpointsData(mesh=[4,4,4])
```
