In conjunction with the Shelter app, I installed a work profile. Apps from the work profile are not listed in the main view of Tracker Control, which makes it impossible to control their blocking status. In fact, when an app is duplicated, so that one version exists in each profile, even the private/regular profile version is not listed.

This was observed with the 2020.05.08-fdroid version.
