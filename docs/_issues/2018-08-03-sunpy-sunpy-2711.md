This can only be implemented post #2691. 

The parsing mechanism can be lot simpler if we can leverage parsing with the already existing format [`TimeString`](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/49c7b7fc6051ec4d6992985e0c6cf0071cf71148/astropy/time/formats.py#L738).

There are some issues with using the above:

- Does not parse `2018-01-01T24:00:00` to `2018-01-02T00:00:00`
- Assumes anything after `.` is a decimal second.

This might mean that we have to overload the `parse_string` method of `TimeString`. This shouldn't be done as a copy paste of the current parsing mechanism. 

Some advantages:

- Better integration with `astropy.time.Time`
- `Time.__repr__`  will show the formatted time similar to input.
