When reviewing prior entries in the diary, one can not review whether he/she has entered yes/no at certain question and one can not review the answer at sliders. Sliders fix should be straightforward. I suggest a solution for the Yes/No button fix, make it turn a certain colour in the review to indicate which option was chosen.
