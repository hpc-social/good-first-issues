As it stands, a significant portion of the [SVI tutorial code](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/blob/dev/tutorial/source/svi_part_i.ipynb) is written in markdown code blocks, rather than standalone Jupyter cells. When formatted this way, the tutorial's notebook cannot be excecuted and experimented with by the reader. I suggest that the markdown code blocks should be refactored into Jupyter code cells.
