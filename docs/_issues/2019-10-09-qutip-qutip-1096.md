QuTiP currently uses QCircuit 2 (version of 2011) to generate LaTeX circuits that are printed to screen or saved to file. A newer version of QCircuit is available, 2.6.0 (2018) https://www.ctan.org/pkg/qcircuit.

* `qcircuit` could be updated to the latest version 

* Also, the use of this open source package could be highlighted more evidently in the documentation.

* Another package has been recently released, https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03842, Quantikz, which has some features related to noise that could be useful especially with regard to PR #1065, Google Summer of Code project by @BoxiLi on noise modeling in QIP. As this other package is very young, maybe an option to draw the circuit with this package, instead of qcircuit, could be given, also to avoid issues.
