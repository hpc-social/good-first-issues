In the section of " [Data Exploration Â» Load events and plot light curve](https://docs.stingray.science/notebooks/Spectral%20Timing/Spectral%20Timing%20Exploration.html#Lags-and-coherence)", the "-1" with the time lag in the lag-energy spectrum is not correct for the current version of stingray. It should be removed.
