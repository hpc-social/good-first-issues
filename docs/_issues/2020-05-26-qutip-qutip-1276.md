Would the use of [plotly](https://plotly.com/) to make the 3d plots better looking and reactive? I'm no expert but it seems very nice especially for 3D visualization in the browser that got integration with [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) (Another app that natively runs in the browser is Bokeh, but that may be more oriented toward data science visualization, while plotly seems more general).  It also seems that plotly surpassed [mayavi](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/) in recent times, with more users, features and more actively developed. This could be relevant for notebooks especially when on My Binder, etc.
