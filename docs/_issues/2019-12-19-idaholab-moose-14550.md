## Bug Description
If we add a wrong parameter (non-required) in a mesh generator, the code will run fine in `--mesh-only` mode although it should produce a warning or error.

## Steps to Reproduce
Can be produced by intentionally introducing a typo in a non-required parameter.

## Impact
Prevent unexpected behavior from happening.
