### What is the expected enhancement?

Right now most of our testing for `retworkx-core` is done via doc tests and via the retworkx crate's use of it. We do get a fair amount of coverage from these but since the library is designed for rust consumption it'd be good to have some dedicated tests in the retworkx-core crate for testing the specifics of the consumption of the library from rust that go into more depth than what the doc tests cover.
