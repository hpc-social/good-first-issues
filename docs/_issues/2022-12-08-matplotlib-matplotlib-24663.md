### Problem

There was a PR to set the shadow color for legend which is now closed: #18668 

### Proposed solution

Revive that PR. The fair thing to do is to add a Co-authored-by with the original author even if it looks like you will have to copy-and-paste the code. (If you rewrite it independently, there is of course no need to do that.) 

Note that there are still some review comments left to handle.
