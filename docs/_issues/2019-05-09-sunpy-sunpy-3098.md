### Description
<!-- Provide a general description of the feature you would like. -->
<!-- "If you want to, you can suggest a draft design or API. -->
<!-- This way we have a deeper discussion on the feature. -->
It could be useful to provide the size of the occulting disk in coronagraph imagery and mask out the pixels that are inside that disk since they contain no useful data.

### Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->
<!-- This part is optional. -->
This would enable checks of wether a pixel is actual measured coronal emission or not.
