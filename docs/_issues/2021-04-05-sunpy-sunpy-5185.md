Some of the data files in SSWIDL are in `.geny` format.  For example, some files relevant to [xrtpy](https://github.com/HinodeXRT/xrtpy) are in the [directory containing response information for different channels for Hinode/XRT](https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssw/hinode/xrt/idl/response/channels/).  Following the question by @joyvelasquez in #1927 , it'd be helpful to add the capability to read in `geny` files too.
