#### Summary:

`int_step(x)` and `step(x)` return different values for 0.

The version of `step(x)` matches the BUGS definition and the standard definition of the Heaviside step function.  Therefore, it should not be changed.  

Changing `int_step()`'s behavior would be confusing, so instead it should be deprecated and replaced with a suggestion to replace existing uses of `int_step(n)` with the boolean expression `(n >= 0)`, which evaluates to 1 if `n >= 0` and 0 otherwise.

#### Current Version:
v2.17.0
