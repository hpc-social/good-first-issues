 ### 🐞**Problem**

The docs are partially outdated. This issue is intended to track all the problems and fix them successively.
- [ ] ~⭐ API docs need improvements (general language and grammatical)~ ➡️ **Moved to #630**.
- [x] See #540.
- [x] The example on the landing page uses `perihelion` which does not exist. Use `precession`.
- [x] `Blog` points to `https://docs.einsteinpy.org/`
- [ ] ⭐ The changes to the user_guide / Introduction in the [`latest` / `0.5.0dev`](https://docs.einsteinpy.org/en/latest/user_guide.html) version needs to be backported to [`stable` / `0.4.0`](https://docs.einsteinpy.org/en/stable/user_guide.html), since the code behaviour is the same between these versions. This has been a source of several issues recently.
