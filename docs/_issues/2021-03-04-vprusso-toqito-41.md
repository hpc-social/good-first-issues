Implement a function that calculates the max-relative entropy for quantum states. 

The functionality for this should be created in `state_props/max_relative_entropy.py` with corresponding unit tests found in `tests/test_state_props/test_max_relative_entropy.py`. Be sure to also update the docs in `/docs/states.rst` under "Properties of Quantum States" with `toqito.state_props.max_relative_entropy.py`.
