### What is the expected enhancement?
A graph is semiconnected if, and only if, for any pair of nodes, either one is reachable from the other, or they are mutually reachable. 

For reference, see https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.components.is_semiconnected.html#networkx.algorithms.components.is_semiconnected

For the implementation, we can consider adapting `petgraph::condesation` function https://docs.rs/petgraph/0.6.0/petgraph/algo/fn.condensation.html. We can't use it directly since it only works with `petgraph::Graph` but we have a `petgraph::StableGraph` as our underlying graph data structure.
