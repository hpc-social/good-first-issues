### What is the expected enhancement?


The `metric_closure()` and `steiner_tree()` functions available at: https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx/blob/main/src/steiner_tree.rs should be straightforward to port to rustworkx-core and rework as generic for any petgraph graph and then update the python functions to call the inner rustworkx-core function. This will then expose this functionality to any rust users that might want this functionality.
