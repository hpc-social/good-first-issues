Hi,

Thanks for the work! Here is a code snippet.

In example.pxd
```python
cdef class ParentClass:
    cdef void print_(self)
```

In example.pyx
```python
cdef class ParentClass:
    cdef void print_(self):
        print("here")

f = ParentClass()
with nogil:
    f.temp()
```

While compiling the sources, the error raised is Constructing Python tuple not allowed without gil, which is a bit confusing.

Thanks!
