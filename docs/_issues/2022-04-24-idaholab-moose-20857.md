title: "Remove INSFVMomentumFriction"

## Reason
We originally added the object to fake a representation of a heat exchanger. Now that we have `PINSFVMomentumFriction`, we can use that instead

## Design
Delete `INSFVMomentumFriction`

## Impact
Should be little impact on users because they can replace with `PINSFVMomentumFriction`. Positive impact for us as maintainers because we can just focus on `PINSFVMomentumFriction`
