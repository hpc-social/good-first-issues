```R
x = sample(1000)
y = sample(1000)

sx = Set$new(x)
sy = Set$new(y)

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  setdiff(x, y),
  sx - sy,
  unit = "s"
)

```

Gives a mean time in seconds of:

setdiff(x,y) =  4.681405e-05
sx - sy = 1.639163e-02

A considerable difference. The additional bloat is due to a lot of checks that sort through the correct dispatch methods and use tricks for other more complicated set types. Some overhead is unavoidable but perhaps the quickest fix is to add a conditional at the start of each set operation that tests if both objects are sets or tuples, and if true, then calls the base functions. Note that this overhead is required for more complicated classes.
