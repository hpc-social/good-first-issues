Since Pyro supports exclusively Python 3, we should look into adding [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). This has a few advantages:
- pep8 linters can check for type errors
- easier for a reader to understand function signatures. useful for eg [funsor](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor) where multiple dispatching is prevalent.
- sphinx docs can [autogenerate types](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autodoc-typehints/) of args
- IDE static analysis tools will work (better)

e.g.
```
from typing import List, Optional

def foo(bar: List, baz: Optional[List] = None) -> List:
    return bar
```

## Add type hints to modules
- [ ] contrib
- [ ] distributions
- [ ] infer
- [ ] nn
- [ ] ops
- [x] optim #2853
- [ ] params
- [ ] poutine
- [ ] scripts

## Additional functionality for type hints

- [ ] Give warnings on  _#type ignore_ in codebase 
  Grey might be a good idea for finding _#type ignores_
- [ ] Give warnings on  modules skipped by mypy
