Would be nice to have somewhere to document and perhaps also test NumPy functions that work fine with Dask Arrays. Admittedly this might be better in NumPy, but it would avoid some user confusion if it were noted somewhere at least. Including them here would be a start. Perhaps one way to kind of tackle this would be implement Dask Array functions that just reuse the NumPy implementations and test them for behavior and laziness. Thoughts?
