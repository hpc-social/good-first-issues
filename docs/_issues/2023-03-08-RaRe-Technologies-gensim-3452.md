Links in the `Documentation` section of our official PyPI page are broken (return 404): 
https://pypi.org/project/gensim/#documentation-1

OTOH, links at https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim#documentation work, so it looks like the PyPI version contains obsolete links that got out of sync.
