See [this comment](https://github.com/lcpp-org/RustBCA/pull/65#discussion_r521617515).

[rcpr](https://github.com/drobnyjt/rcpr) is still early in development, and building it is tricky. What dependencies are actually required to build it as-is? How can those be slimmed down/removed? Is there a standalone eigenvalue algorithm that could be used instead of the heavy numerical backends? Is it worthwhile to write a custom eigenvalue solver in rcpr?
