**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Many static type checkers have issues finding Cython's stubs.
Here is from running mypy on my current project:
```
error: Skipping analyzing "cython": found module but no type hints or library stubs
```
The same issue can be seen when using `import Cython as cython`:
```
error: Skipping analyzing "Cython": found module but no type hints or library stubs
```

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Being able to take advantage of static type checkers when developing.

**Additional context**
Inspecting my installation of Cython, it doesn't appear that Shadow.pyi is included:

This could have to do with the issues experienced.
