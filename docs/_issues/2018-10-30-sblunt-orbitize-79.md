Related to issue #37. We should have some approved tools for assessing convergence of MCMC walkers, since it is probably the trickiest part of MCMC orbit fitting. Similarly, we should expand the MCMC tutorial. 

- [ ] function that returns the autocorrelation time of the chains
- [ ] documentation in the MCMC tutorial on how to use the above feature to assess convergence
