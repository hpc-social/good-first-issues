### Problem

At the moment it feels inconvenient to close the Contextual Help panel with the mouse and counter-intuitive since it is opened with the 'Show Contextual Help' keyboard hotkey. Sometimes it is even annoying since I might leave contextual help open and unintentionally select a large object which freezes the interface while the object is 'printed' to the Contextual Help.

### Proposed Solution


My feature request is to change 'Show Contextual Help' to 'Show/Hide Contextual Help', i.e. toggle contextual help with the existing hotkey.

Another, more general, 'solution' could be hotkeys for navigating and closing panels.
