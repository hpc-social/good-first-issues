title: "`RotatedSunFrame` should accept an `astropy.time.TimeDelta` object as `durations=` input"

### Describe the feature

If you do `map1.date - map2.date` and pass that into `durations=` you get a `TimeDelta` object which isn't a valid quantity so you have to call the `.to` method which seems silly.
