### Pandas version checks

- [X] I have checked that the issue still exists on the latest versions of the docs on `main` [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/)


### Location of the documentation

https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.api.extensions.register_index_accessor.html#pandas.api.extensions.register_index_accessor

### Documentation problem

There is no example showing how to create or what is required on the class to make an index accessor.

### Suggested fix for documentation

Add a link to an example or expand the topic to include a how to implement this.  Also document what is required to make a custom indexer.
