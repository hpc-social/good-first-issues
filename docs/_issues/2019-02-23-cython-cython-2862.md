Cython has to know the qualified module name at compile time, so the absolute package path of a relative import is actually known at compile time. We cannot change the way relative first imports work in general, because they are actually looked up relative to the current package, but we can still speed up re-imports (which are actually not that uncommon). Cython can construct the qualified name of a relative module import at compile time and look that up in `sys.modules` (as done in the `ImportDottedModule` helper function for absolute imports).

Requires C / C-API knowledge.
