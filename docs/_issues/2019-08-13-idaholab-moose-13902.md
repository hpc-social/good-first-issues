<!--Why do you need this feature or what is the enhancement?-->

The ImageDiff test object uses skimage python package to compute the "Structural Similarity" (SSIM). This is a large dependency for a rather simple calculation. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity

## Design
<!--A concise description (design) of what you want to happen.--->

I would like to add a ssim function to mooseutils, so that we can do the following.

```python
import mooseutils
index = mooseutils.ssim('file0.png', 'file1.png')
```

- The files provided should be read with `matplotlib.imread` and the function should also 
support a version that accepts the loaded data rather than the filename.
- The ImageDiffer.py:127 can then be replaced with the new function.
- The implementation should include some unittesting.

## Impact
<!--Will the enhancement change existing public APIs, internal APIs, or add something new?-->
This should be drop-in replacement for our current function so no API will change, but it will allow us to remove a large python dependency.
