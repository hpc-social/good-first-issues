Currently we are just catching (thanks @c-martinez ) errors when the query uses undeclared prefixes. This is very common.

At the moment the backend fails silently, and simply no OpenAPI spec is rendered for the offending query prefixes. Using the UI to at least show some error (and suggestions for fixing) would be a great addition.

Another option would be to intelligently try to guess the prefix, by e.g. keeping a hard-coded list of common prefixes, issuing a request to prefix.cc, etc.
