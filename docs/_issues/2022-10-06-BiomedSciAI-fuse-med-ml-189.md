Hey!
This issue aims to added documentation for **FuseMedML** using Read the Docs automating building.

Currently we have [this](https://fuse-med-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is clearly irrelevant. The end goal is to have Fuse's documentation nicely documented on Read the Docs to help  AI researchers get started with our tools.
Please visit [here](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html) for a good example.

Also note that the badge [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/fuse-med-ml/badge/?version=latest)](https://fuse-med-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) should be 'passing'.
