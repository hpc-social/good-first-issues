The documentation per function is currently rather bare. By including 2d heatmap plots and/or 3d landscape plots of the functions, it will be easier for users to inspect the functions for landscape properties they may be looking for.

The plots should be made using a single 'default' function that can simply be given a `MultiFideltiyFunction` object.
