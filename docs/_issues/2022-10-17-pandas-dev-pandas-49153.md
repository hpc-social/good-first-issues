### Pandas version checks

- [X] I have checked that the issue still exists on the latest versions of the docs on `main` [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/)


### Location of the documentation

https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.TimedeltaIndex.html

### Documentation problem

Missing two parameters, closed and dtype

### Suggested fix for documentation

Add these two parameters with types ane explanation
